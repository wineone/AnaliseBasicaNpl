360,I don't want to argue but it's time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive.,fru
361,"You know?  Why shouldn't he walk the nights thinking of him, dreaming of him?   Do we contradict him?  Do we say, we don't have any hope anymore?  That we haven't had any hope for years now?",fru
362,You can't say that to him.,fru
363,We've got to say it to him.,neu
364,Where's the proof?  Do you have any proof?,fru
365,"For God's sake, three years?  Nobody comes back after three years; that's insane.",fru
366,"To you it is, to me it is, but to your father, you can talk yourself until you are blue in the face.  But there is no grave and there is no body, so where are you?",fru
367,"Sit down, Mom.  I want to talk to you.",neu
368,"It's that the trouble is those God damn newspapers.  Every month some new boy comes back and so the next one is going to be Larry, they just--",xxx
369,"All right, all right, all right.  You know why I asked Annie here, right?",fru
370,Why?,fru
371,You know.,neu
372,"Well I got an idea, but what's your story?",neu
373,I'm going to ask her to marry me.,neu
374,"Well that's only your business, Chris.",xxx
375,You know it's not just my business.,neu
376,Well what do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,xxx
377,"So all right then, I'll just go ahead with it?",neu
378,Well you want to make sure that your father is not going to --,xxx
379,Then it's not just my business.,fru
380,I'm just saying.,xxx
381,"You know sometimes you infuriate me.  you know that?  Isn't it your business if I tell father and he throws a fit about it?  God, you have such a talent for ignoring things.",ang
382,Oh.  I ignore what I got to ignore.  That girl is Larry's girl.,xxx
383,She's not Larry's girl.,fru
384,"From your father's point of view, he is not dead and- Chris he still thinks he's still alive.  The girl is Larry's girl.",fru
385,"Now you can go on from there if you know where to go, but I'm telling you, I don't know where to go.",fru
386,"I don't know why it is, but every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because I am afraid other people will suffer. My whole bloody life, time after time.",fru
387,"You're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong in that.",fru
388,To hell with that.,fru
389,I just don't see why.  Have you asked Annie yet?,fru
390,I wanted to get this settled first.,neu
391,Well how do you know she's going to marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way your father does.,fru
392,"Well if she does, then that's it.  That's the end of it.  From her letters, though, I think she's pretty much forgotten him.",neu
393,And then we'll thrash it out with father.  Okay Mom?  Don't avoid me.,neu
394,The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,fru
395,So what.  I'm not fast with women.,fru
396,Why does it have to be Annie?,fru
397,Because it is.,fru
398,Oh that's a great reason.  It's no reason at all.,fru
399,I don't know.,fru
400,"You haven't seen her since you went away to war, it's been five years.",fru
401,"I can't help it, I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her, you know?  These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.",fru
402,"Mom, what do you want?  A diagram?",fru
403,I don't want a diagram.,fru
404,He thinks he's coming back Chris.,fru
405,"You marry that girl, you are pronouncing him dead...",fru
406,...and then what's that going to do to your father?  Do you know?  I don't.,fru
407,"All right, then, Mom. [BREATHING]",fru
408,Just give it some more thought.,neu
409,"I've given it three years of thought.  And I'd hope that if I waited, father would forget about Larry and then we could just have a regular wedding and everyone would be happy.",fru
410,"But if I can't do that here, I may have to go somewhere else.",fru
411,What the hell is this?,ang

415,You have a business here.  What the hell is this?,ang
416,The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,fru
417,Oh.  Must you be inspired?,ang
418,"Yes.  I like it for an hour a day.  I don't care if I have to grub for money all day long, when I come home I want it happy.",fru
419,"I want some kids, I want a family, I want somebody that I can give myself to and Annie is in the center of that.  Now it's just where to find it.",fru
420,You mean to tell me that you would leave the business over this?,fru
421,"On this, I would.",neu
422,Well you don't want to think like that.,fru
423,Then help me stay here.,neu
424,"All right.  But you don't want to think like that because what the hell are we working for, Chris?  It's all for you.  This whole shooting match is for you.",ang
425,I know that.  Then just help me stay here.,fru
426,Just don't think like that.,ang
427,Well I am thinking like that.,fru
428,"I don't understand you, do I?",fru
429,No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,fru
430,I can see that.,fru
431,Why did he invite her here?,xxx
432,Why does that bother you?,xxx

434,Well maybe...maybe he just wanted to see her.,neu
435,Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,xxx
436,"What do you mean?  You know he lived next door to the girl his whole life, why wouldn't he want to see her?",xxx
437,[BREATHING] You don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anything more than he told you.,fru
438,He's not going to marry her.,ang
439,How do you know he's even thinking about it?,neu
440,It's got that about it.,ang
441,Oh.  So what.,xxx
442,"What is going on here, Joe?",ang
443,Now listen.,fru
444,She is not his girl.  She knows she's not.,ang
445,You can't read her mind.,fru
446,"Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men, why is she still single?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she waited.",ang
447,How do you know why she waited?,neu
448,"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my darkest moments, I think of her waiting and I know that I'm right.",ang
449,"Hey look, it's a nice day, huh?  Why are we arguing?",fru
450,"Nobody in this house dares take away her faith, Joe.  You know strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",ang
451,What do you want me to do? What do you want?,fru
452,"I want you to-- I want you to act like he is coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since Chris invited her here.",ang
453,I won't stand for any nonsense.,ang
454,Kate.,fru
455,"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  Oh laugh, laugh all you like but why does this happen the very night he comes back.  She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look at it, Joe, look.",ang
456,[BREATHING],fru
457,Calm yourself.,fru
458,"Just believe with me, Joe. Only last week a man came back in Detroit missing longer than Larry.  Believe with me. You, above all, have got to believe. Just believe.",ang
459,Okay. Calm yourself.,fru

474,What?,neu
475,Sort of embarrassed ever since I got here.,neu
476,Well I was kind of planning of sneaking up on you over the course of a week or so.  They just take it for granted that we're all set.,neu
477,I knew they would.,neu
478,You did?,xxx
479,"Well sure, from your mother's point of view.  Why else would I come?",neu

525,"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that, exactly.  Just a little more selfish and they would all be here today.",sad

578,Why not?,neu
579,I just don't.  It's stupid.,xxx

581,"Pass what up?  I mean these fish swim out of the ocean, they flop around on the beach, they swim away and then they die.",fru
582,Yeah.  But this..this moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do - spawning or mating or whatever.,neu
583,This is a big night for these little guys.  It's like life's last orgy.,neu
584,I don't see why you're so excited; this isn't a freaking moon landing we are talking about.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.,xxx
585,Yeah they do.,fru
586,Oh Augie,fru

596,Hmm.  We didn't see them the year before either.,fru

614,About what I was saying.,neu
615,I think it's ridiculous.,xxx
616,It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,xxx

627,"For God- Grow up, Augie.  The fish are not going to arrive.",ang
628,Why not?,fru

631,Twice is every time we have tried; that's ever.,ang
632,They'll show up this time.,fru

642,Okay.  I'm trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here.,fru

1759,I just think it's silly you know to go on and on and on about such a thing.,xxx
1760,You can hardly call three glasses of liquor in a whole evening going on and on and on.,xxx

1788,I am not in the least bit drunk.,ang
1789,You always had a weak head.,ang
1790,I think I told you once before that I had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long.  A Child of two cannot get drunk on that.,ang

2300,"Well then why is she still single?  I mean, New York is full of men.  Why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy, but she's waited.",fru
2301,How do you know why she's waited?,neu
2302,"She knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",fru
2303,"Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?",fru
2304,"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe?  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",xxx
2305,"Well, what do you want me to do about it?",fru
2306,I want you to act like he's coming back.  Both of you.  Don't you think I haven't noticed since she got here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.,fru
2307,But Kate--,fru
2308,"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.  I mean, laugh--laugh at me, but...",ang
2309,But why did that happen the very night she came here?  She sleeps in his room and his memorial breaks to pieces.  Just look.  Look at it.,ang
2310,Calm yourself.,fru

2312,Calm yourself.,fru

2327,"No, not sorry.  Um, but, I'm- I'm not gonna stay.",xxx
2328,Why?,xxx
2329,"Well, for one thing, your mother as much as told me to go.",xxx
2330,Oh.,xxx
2331,"You saw that.  I mean and then, well, you've been kind of, um--",xxx
2332,What?,xxx
2333,"Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.",xxx
2334,"The trouble is, I planned on sort of sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But, they take it for granted that we're all set.",xxx
2335,"I knew they would, your mother anyway.",xxx
2336,"Well,",xxx
2337,"from her point of view, why else would I come?",sad

2341,I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.,xxx
2342,I'm embarrassing you and I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted some place we'd never been before.  A place where we'd be brand new to each other.,xxx
2343,"You feel it's wrong here, don't you?  This yard, this chair.  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to have to win you away from anything.",exc

2346,I almost got married two years ago.,hap
2347,Why didn't you?,xxx
2348,You started to write me and--,hap
2349,You felt something that far back?,xxx
2350,Every day since.,hap
2351,"Anne, why didn't you let me know?",xxx
2352,"Well, I was waiting for you.  I mean, till then you never wrote and when you did, I mean, what did you say?  You can sure be ambiguous sometimes.",xxx
2353,"Give me a kiss, Anne.  Give me a-",xxx
2354,"oh God, I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long--how long I've been waiting to kiss you.",xxx
2355,I will never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I did was sit and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,hap
2356,"Oh, Annie, we're gonna live now.  I'm gonna make you so happy.",xxx
2357,Not like that you're not.,xxx
2358,I kissed you.,xxx
2359,"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it?",xxx
2360,Let's drive someplace.  I want to be alone with you.,xxx
2361,"No.  What is it, your mother?",xxx
2362,No.  Nothing like that.,sad
2363,"Then, what's wrong?  I mean, even in your letters there was some--something ashamed.",sad
2364,"Yeah, I suppose I have been.  But it's going from me.",sad
2365,You've gotta tell me.,sad
2366,I don't know how to start.,sad
2367,It wouldn't work this way.,sad
2368,"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",sad
2369,"Yeah, sure.",sad
2370,"Well, I lost them.",sad
2371,How many?,sad
2372,Just about all.,sad
2373,"Oh, gee.",sad
2374,It takes some time for a guy to toss that off.  'Cause they weren't just men.,sad
2375,"For instance, one time, it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks.  I put them in pocket.  It's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",sad
2376,"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",sad
2377,"I got this idea watching them go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that there was one new thing being made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man.",sad
2378,"You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.",sad
2379,Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.,sad
2380,"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",sad
2381,"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",sad
2382,Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.,sad
2383,You still feel that way?,sad
2384,I want you now Annie.,xxx
2385,"'Cause you mustn't feel that way.  Because you have a right to everything that you have.  Do you understand that?  Everything, Chris, and me too.",xxx
2386,"I mean, and your money, there's nothing wrong with your money.  I mean, your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  A man should be paid for that.",xxx
2387,"I know Annie.  Annie, I'm gonna make a fortune for you.",xxx
2388,What'll I do with a fortune?,hap
2389,What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.,exc
2390,"This is great, isn't it?  Look at the night we've got here, couldn't be better.",exc

2392,How you doing?,exc
2393,Fine.,xxx
2394,Is that--no--is that just foam?  I can't even tell.,exc
2395,"Well, I guess we can tell, it probably isn't right?  Probably be unmistakable don't you think?",exc
2396,"How you doing?  Aw, you know what I forgot?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  Oh, how could I be so stupid?  I should've brought my flashlight.",exc
2397,What flashlight?,neu
2398,"You know, the flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?",xxx
2399,That's not your flashlight.,xxx
2400,Who's is it?,xxx
2401,It's ours.  It's mine too.,xxx
2402,"Oh, well sure.",neu
2403,"You kept saying my flashlight, if as if somehow it's just yours.  I mean is that supposed to make me feel?",xxx
2404,"Right, of course.  Our flashlight.  Mine and yours.  I mean, me flashlight is su flashlight naturally.",neu
2405,How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.,xxx
2406,"I wonder, do they always run during a full moon?  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Do you remember?",neu
2407,Yeah.,neu
2408,"You cold?  Do you want my jacket?  Oh, we should've brought the blanket.  Our blanket.",neu
2409,"This is great, isn't it?  A six pack would be just the ticket right now.",exc
2410,I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.,exc
2411,You think they can hear us talk?  Or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?,exc
2412,I'm cold.,xxx
2413,Do you want my jacket?,neu
2414,"It's after eleven, let's just go home.",fru
2415,Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home.,xxx
2416,There is no point in coming down here.,xxx
2417,Right.,neu
2418,That's my point.,xxx
2419,That's my point too.,neu
2420,"So, let's go.",xxx
2421,No. No. That's not my point.  The point is there's no point in coming down if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?,neu
2422,Not particularly.,xxx
2423,Why not?,xxx
2424,I just don't.  It's stupid.,xxx
2425,"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year, you know.",xxx
2426,"Think about the people in Kansas, they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this.  We live forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.",exc
2427,"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, they flop around, and swim away.  And then they die.",fru
2428,"Yeah, but that moment on the beach, is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping is laying eggs or what do you--spawning or mating.  I mean,",exc
2429,this is a big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.,exc
2430,"What are you so excited about?  I mean, it's not a moon landing we're talking about here.  It's fish.  It's a fish nobody even eats.",fru
2431,Yeah they do.,fru
2432,"Ah, Augie.",fru
2433,Alright.  But it's fish that do something that none of the other fish do.  Like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs.,exc
2434,There's--there's a bit of the magic--some unexplainable here.  I don't see how you can not be interested.,xxx
2435,I'm just not.,fru
2436,For real?,xxx
2437,Yeah.,xxx
2438,"I don't get it.  The first time we came here, you said it was the best night of your life.",neu
2439,"And last year, I remember specifically you were so excited to go that you stubbed your toe rushing me out of the house and didn't even notice until we got in the car.",xxx
2440,"Last year, you will also remember our shoes got wet, I got sand in my panties, you got a sore throat, we got in a big fight over nothing, and we didn't see the grunions.",fru
2441,We weren't in a good spot.,neu
2442,We didn't see them the first time either.,neu
2443,"We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  Believe me, I've got good instincts for these things.",xxx
2444,There is that--no that's just seaweed isn't it?,exc
2445,"Oh man, this is great, isn't it?  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  Here, think about this, all right, I know you're not interested, but think about this.",exc
2446,"Somewhere out there, this huge mass of silver fish swimming this way.",xxx
2447,"They don't know why, we don't know why.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map, it wasn't a decision, just-",xxx
2448,"all as one, this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.  And they're swimming right now as if that's all that matters.",exc
2449,It's like single mindedness with no mind.  It's urgency that's pure urge.  They don't know what drives them.  They don't ask it a question or give it a name.,exc
2450,"They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.",exc
2451,"Ah, God, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  Look, all my hairs are popped up.",exc
2452,That's the wind.,xxx
2453,"Well, so what do you think?",neu
2454,About what?,neu
2455,What I was saying.,neu
2456,It's ridiculous.,xxx
2457,"Well, so what do you think?",exc
2458,About what?,neu
2459,What I was saying.,neu
2460,It's ridiculous.,fru
2461,It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,neu
2462,It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is gonna take place on the beach.,xxx
2463,"Well, I'm not the only one.  Look at all these people.",neu
2464,"Sure, everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all excited.  It keeps us coming back for more.  It keeps us thinking that life is gonna start any second now if we could just find the right spot and get in on the action.",xxx
2465,Are we talking about the same thing?,xxx
2466,"Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me.",xxx
2467,"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?",neu
2468,"God damn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.",ang
2469,"Well, what's bugging you?",fru
2470,We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.,ang
2471,"There's nothing to it.  We come here, the grunion arrive, they do their little fish business, we go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home. We go home.",neu
2472,"For heaven sake, we're not going to see the grunions.",fru
2473,Why not?,fru
2474,"We never do, do we?  I mean, have we ever?",fru
2475,We've missed them twice.  That's not ever.,neu
2476,Twice is every time we've tried. That's ever.,fru
2477,"Well, we'll see them this year.",neu
2478,"No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.",fru
2479,"I mean, I feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.",ang
2480,I thought you wanted to see it.,fru
2481,You don't understand anything I'm saying.,fru
2482,"No, of course not.",fru
2483,I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is.,fru
2484,It's just fish.  Nothing to get traumatized about.,neu
2485,"For heaven sake, this isn't about fish.",xxx
2486,"All right.  Look, I've been trying to work this backwards, but I cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst.",fru
2487,"I mean, you were-  you were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see.  I took a shower.  You watched the news.",xxx
2488,"You said, ""Hey the grunion are running tonight.""  I said, ""Great, let's go.  I feel lucky.""",neu
2489,"Okay, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals, getting the car out of the garage--",neu
2490,"Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago, right after we got married.",sad
2491,"I thought I was pregnant, you had a bottle of champagne, but no glasses.  You asked me to dance, so we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",sad
2492,"And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.",sad
2493,"And I remember thinking, this is it.  You know, at last--at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be.",sad
2494,Wait a minute.  I've got it.,neu
2495,"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",sad
2496,"It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said, ""let's get some champagne,"" and I said, ""time's a wasting"" or something like that, right?",neu
2497,"Yeah, of course, I see it now.  You want this to be like that other time, right?  That's it, right?",neu
2498,I'd rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.,sad
2499,"Okay, yeah, sure, I see it now.  Listen, you wanna dance?",neu
2500,No.,sad
2501,You want me to go get some champagne?,neu
2502,No.,sad
2503,Take off our shoes?,neu
2504,No. No.,xxx
2505,"Well, what?  You want me to breathe in your ear?",fru
2506,No.,sad
2507,You wanna get married again?,fru
2508,No.,fru
2509,What?  What?  You want a divorce?,fru
2510,No.,fru
2511,A vacation?,fru
2512,No.,fru
2513,"A new carpet?  A poodle?  Ice cream?  Back rub?  A suicide pact?  What?  What?  Carla, what the hell do you want?",fru
2514,I want something to turn out the way that it's supposed to.,xxx
2515,"Well, welcome to the human race.  Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed?  That four years down the road, we'd be at the beach yelling at each other over fish?",ang
2516,"No.  You think I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like a used Kleenex?  Or that I'd look at you and think, holy hell, when's the next flight to Alaska?",xxx
2517,"No, Carla, I'm just like you.  I thought it was gonna be all peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us",sad
2518,"'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",fru
2519,This.  What?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,xxx
2520,"Yes, it is.",neu
2521,"Uh, right this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",xxx
2522,Right.,neu
2523,Well.  This isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,sad
2524,"I know, me neither.",sad
2525,"I mean, this is just this.  It includes a lot and everything, but it isn't something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",xxx
2526,I'm doing the best I can.,sad
2527,"I know that, Augie.  Really, I do.",sad
2528,"I know that you meant this to be special and nice and the sand and the moon and all, but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",sad
2529,Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,sad
2530,I didn't say that.,sad
2531,"No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.",sad
2532,"Oh, for heaven sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",xxx
2533,Yeah?,sur
2534,"Oh, don't be ridiculous.  I mean, don't you know that?",xxx
2535,You're the one who probably wishes you were with someone else.  Someone who--you'd rather enjoy yourself and didn't take everything so hard.,sad
2536,"Well, now that you mention it.  No, I don't.",xxx
2537,"Okay.  Fine so.  We're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.",xxx

2587,Yes.  Yes. With all his might.,exc

2598,Which particular one?,hap
2599,The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it on my bed.,neu
2600,Charles.  That was his name.  Charles.  He did wriggle so beautifully.,hap

2853,I don't know what I'm going to do about this; I mean,fru

2855,"You've been doing a lot of work for it, right?",neu
2856,"Well, yea you know, I get my resumes and I mean I-",fru
2857,"Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is -",neu
2858,"I go out all the places I can, every place that'll give an interview you know.",fru
2859,"you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can.",neu
2860,"But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, or",fru
2861,"Well, but you care about what you do, right?",neu
2862,"I don't know, I mean why - why",fru
2863,"Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know.",fru
2864,"I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh",neu
2865,"Well, and that's what I begin to question after a while is maybe I just don't want it, maybe it's not even worth it, you know, like",xxx
2866,"I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know.",fru
2867,"Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself.",neu
2868,"Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else.",fru
2869,You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's,neu
2870,"I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table.",fru
2871,"Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time.",neu
2872,"I mean, maybe I'm not, you know. I don't have a job. Maybe - maybe I'm not as good as-as I thought I was and",fru
2873,I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and,fru
2874,I'm sorry.,sad
2875,"I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking",sad
2876,"maybe - maybe take up painting, I don't know, you know.",fru
2877,"Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know.",fru
2878,Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.,fru
2879,"That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like",neu
2880,"and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.",neu
2881,So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.,neu
2882,"I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn't",fru
2883,"It might be the latter I don't know because you're not the worst, I mean you're great, you very talented at what you do.",xxx
2884,this doesn't happen to a normal person.,ang
2885,"You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.",neu
2886,"But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.",neu
2887,"I mean, I don't know, I don't see - I don't see any other way - any other way around it right now.",fru
2888,"Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop.",neu
2889,What am I going to do on a break?,xxx
2890,"Get out of town or something, I mean you need - you need to clear your head 'cause you seem like you're really frustrated about it. I mean you need to like, be excited about you're doing, rather than, you know upset.",xxx
2891,Right. Thanks for talking to me.,sad
2892,Hi. Um-,neu
2893,"Hi, can I help you?",neu
2894,It seems that uh- my-my bag didn't make it out on the carousel.,neu

2901,"For some reason, so you think it won't show up?",sur
2902,"Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that",neu
2903,Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.,neu
2904,What? What? How does that happen?,xxx
2905,"Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something.",neu
2906,I really - I really need that bag.,fru
2907,"I- I- I understand, but um.",neu
2908,there are- I have important things in that bag. I've got,xxx
2909,Okay,neu
2910,"I mean -- I've been away for a while and- and now I've- I've gifts for- for you know friends and family I mean, I got stuff in the there",fru
2911,Right.,neu
2912,It's worth a lot.,xxx
2913,"I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-",neu
2914,"Not going to show - well isn't like - wouldn't it just be at the airport, that, like, if it didn't get on the other plane",fru
2915,can they check there?,fru
2916,"Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and",neu
2917,on another-,xxx
2918,"they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that.",neu
2919,So we'll- what we'll do,neu
2920,"But we have the tags on. I mean like it wouldn't you know, if it got stuck somewhere it's like well this is nobodies bag I mean maybe you know look on the tag and",ang

3131,He cried hard?,xxx
3132,I could hear him right through the floor in my room.,sad

3134,I guess he is.,xxx
3135,He's getting just like after he died. What is the meaning of that?,xxx
3136,"I don't know the meaning of it, but I know one thing mom, we've made a terrible mistake with dad.",xxx
3137,What?,xxx
3138,Being dishonest with him. I mean that sort of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.,xxx
3139,What do you mean dishonest?,xxx
3140,You know that Larry is not coming back and I know it. Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,fru

3142,"No I don't want to argue with him, but it's about time he realized that nobody believes Larry is alive anymore.",fru
3143,"Why -- why shouldn't he dream of him? Walk around, waiting for him at night I mean do we contradict him, do we say straight out that we don't have any hope anymore that we haven't had hope for years now?",fru
3144,You can't say that to him.,fru
3145,We've got to say it to him.,ang

3157,No it's not only my business.,fru
3158,What do you want me to do; you're old enough to know your own mind.,fru

3161,See it isn't just my business-,ang
3162,I'm just saying,fru
3163,Sometimes you infuriate me you know that. Isn't it your business to if I tell dad and he throws a fit about it? You have such a talent for ignoring things.,xxx
3164,I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.,xxx
3165,She's not Larry's girl.,fru
3166,From father's point of you he isn't dead and you have no right to take his girl.,neu
3167,"You can go on from there if you know where to go but I don't know where to go, see I don't know. So what can I do for you?",fru

3169,You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong with that.,neu
3170,To hell with that.,ang
3171,Have you asked Annie yet?,fru
3172,I wanted to get this settled first.,neu
3173,How do you know she'll marry you? Maybe she feels the same way your father does.,neu
3174,"Well, if she does then that's the end of it. From her letters I think she's forgotten him.",neu
3175,"I don't know, I'll find out. Then we'll trash it out with dad, right? Mom, don't avoid me.",sad
3176,"Trouble is you don't see enough women, you never did.",ang
3177,So what I'm not fast with women.,fru
3178,I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,ang
3179,Because it is.,fru
3180,That's a good answer but it doesn't answer anything. I mean you haven't seen her since you went away to war it's five years.,fru
3181,"I can't help it I know her best. I mean lived next door to her my whole life. These years when I think of a wife, I think of Annie.",fru
3182,"What do you want, a diagram?",xxx

3184,"Do you know what's going to happen to your father because I don't, see?",fru
3185,All right. All right. Mom.,xxx
3186,Just give it some more thought.,xxx
3187,"I've given it three years of thought. I thought that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry and we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.",xxx
3188,"If I can't do that here well, then I'll have to get out.",sad
3189,What the hell is this?,ang
3190,"I'll get out. I'll get married and go live some place else, maybe New York.",sad
3191,"What the hell is this, are you crazy?",ang
3192,"I've been a good son too long a good sucker, I'm through with it.",ang
3193,What about the business? What is this?,ang
3194,The business?  The business doesn't inspire me.,ang
3195,Must you be inspired?,ang
3196,"Yes, I like it and hour a day. If I'm going to grub for money all day long, at least in the evening I want it beautiful.",ang
3197,I want a family; I want kids; I want something I can give myself to. Annie is in the middle of that. Now where do I find it?,xxx
3198,"Tell me, you'd leave the business?",ang
3199,"Yes, on this I would.",sad
3200,"Well, you don't want to think like that.",ang
3201,Then help me stay here.,fru
3202,"All right. But you don't want to be thinking like that 'cause otherwise what did we work for, I mean the whole thing is for you, Chris, the whole shooting match is for you.",xxx
3203,I know I know mom. All right. Just help me stay here.,fru
3204,Just don't go thinking that way.,fru

3210,Why does that bother you?,xxx
3211,She's been in New York three and half years why all of a sudden-,ang
3212,"Well, maybe he just wanted to see her again.",neu
3213,Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,ang
3214,"What do you mean? He lived next door to the girl all his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again?",fru
3215,"Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.",fru
3216,He's not going to marry her.,ang
3217,How do you know he's even thinking of it?,neu
3218,It's got that all about it.,xxx
3219,"Well, so what?",neu
3220,What's going on here Joe?,ang
3221,"All right. Now, listen kid-",xxx
3222,-She's not his girl Joe; she knows she's not.,ang
3223,You can't read her mind.,neu
3224,"Then why is she still single, I mean New York is full of men, why isn't she married? Probably a hundred people told her she's crazy but she's waited.",fru
3225,How do you know why she has waited?,fru
3226,"She knows what I know, that's why. She's faithful as a rock. In my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",fru
3227,"Look it's a nice day, what are we arguing for?",fru
3228,"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away Joe. Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",fru
3229,What do you want me to do about it?,fru
3230,"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you. Don't you think I haven't noticed since he invited her, I won't stand for any nonsense",ang
3231,But Kate,fru
3232,"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself. And laugh -- laugh at me but",fru

3290,I don't know how to start.,xxx

3300,"They didn't die, they killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  I mean, a little more selfish and they'd have been here today.",sad
3301,"I got this idea watching 'em go down.  Everything was being destroyed, see, but it seemed that one new thing was made.  A sort of responsibility.  Man for man. You know what I mean?",sad

3303,"Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here. I mean, the whole thing to them seemed like it's sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.",sad
3304,"And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.",sad
3305,"I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.",sad

3329,How could we forget to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.,xxx

3341,Right.,xxx
3342,That's my point.,fru
3343,That's my point too.,xxx
3344,So let's go.,fru
3345,No. No. That's not my point. The point is there is no point in coming down here if we just leave. Don't you want to see it?,xxx
3346,Not particularly.,neu
3347,Why not?,sur
3348,"I don't, it's just stupid.",fru
3349,"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon. I mean it only happens once a year.",exc
3350,"Think about the people in Kansas, they- they'd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this. We live forty minutes away it's too good to pass up.",exc
3351,"Pass up what? These little fish swim onto the beach flop around and swim away, and then they die.",fru
3352,"Yea, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. I mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you, mating or spotting or something like that.",exc
3353,"This is a big night for these guys, life's last orgy.",exc
3354,What are you so excited about? I mean it's not a moon landing we're talking about here it's fish. It's a fish nobody even eats.,fru
3355,Yes they do.,fru
3356,Augie,fru
3357,"Okay. But it's fish that do something none of the other fish do. Like the swallows returning to Capistrano, or the Lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs",exc

3360,For real?,sur
3361,Yes.,neu
3362,I don't get it. The first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life.,xxx

3365,We weren't in a good spot.,xxx
3366,We didn't see them the first time either.,fru
3367,We just weren't in a good spot; this is a much better spot. I've got good instincts for these things.,fru

3370,"Out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way,",exc
3371,"they don't why, we don't know why. They didn't take a vote or anything; they didn't get a map or an invitation.",exc
3372,"Just all as one. This little time sensitive firecracker, instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the California coast and started swimming. They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.",exc
3373,"It's single mindedness, with no mind, it's urgency that's pure urge, they don't know what drives them. They don't ask it a name or ask it a question,",exc
3374,"they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.",exc

3376,That's the wind.,neu

3381,So what do you think?,neu
3382,About what?,xxx
3383,What I was saying.,neu
3384,It's ridiculous.,fru
3385,Certainly it's not. Slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,neu
3386,It's PR. Someone sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,xxx
3387,"Well, I'm not the only one look at all these people.",xxx
3388,"Yea, sure everyone was sold the same story. I mean it keeps us all excited, keeps us coming back for more, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any second now if we can just get in on the action and find the right spot.",xxx
3389,Are we talking about the same thing?,xxx
3390,I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.,xxx
3391,"Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong but are you having your period?",fru
3392,Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that. I hate it when you ask me that. You always ask me that. It's insulting.,ang
3393,"Well, what's bugging you?",fru
3394,We just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like.,ang
3395,"There is nothing to it, we come here, the Grunion arrive, then do their little fish business, we go oh ah look, they go home, we go home.",fru
3396,For heavens sake we are not going to see the Grunions.,fru
3397,Why not?,fru
3398,"We never do, do we? I mean have we ever?",fru
3399,We've missed them twice; that's not ever.,fru
3400,"Twice is every time we've tried, that's ever.",fru
3401,"Well, we'll see them this year.",neu
3402,"No we won't; it's pointless. It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus,",fru
3403,I mean I feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish won't show up.,ang
3404,I thought you wanted to see them.,fru
3405,You don't understand anything I'm saying.,fru
3406,No of course not.,fru
3407,"I did want to see them, I always do. I mean I keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is.",ang
3408,"It's just fish, I mean nothing to get traumatized over.",xxx
3409,For heavens sake this isn't about fish.,fru
3410,All right. I've been trying to work this backwards but I cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst.,fru
3411,"You were fine during the phone call from Marge, dinner was okay, doing the dishes was no problem, let's see, I took a shower, you watched the news, you said",neu
3412,"""the Grunion are running tonight,"" I said ""great, let's go, I feel lucky,""",neu

3415,"We thought I was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses, you asked me to dance, we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork.",sad
3416,And when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so I could feel them as much as hear them,sad
3417,"and I remember thinking that this is it you know. At last, at last I am as happy as I am supposed to be",sad
3418,Wait a minute I've got it,xxx
3419,"Just dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne out of the bottle.",sad
3420,"It was in the car, right? Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker you said, let's get some champagne and I said times are wasting or something like that, right?",exc
3421,"Of course, I see it now; you want this to be like that other time, right? That's it, right?",exc

3438,I want something to turn out the way that it supposed to.,fru
3439,"Well welcome to the human race, all right. Do you think this is what I had in mind when I proposed? You think I had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?",ang
3440,"You think I knew that there be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex, or that I'd look at you and think holy hell when is the next flight to Alaska?",xxx
3441,"No, no, just like you I thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'll have three, fat, rosy kids and ha-ha baby the joke is on us",fru

3443,"This? What, what is this? This isn't even anything.",fru
3444,"Yes, it is.",xxx
3445,"I'm sure, this is standing on the beach, this is waiting, this is fighting.",fru
3446,Right.,xxx
3447,"Well, but this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.",sad
3448,"No, I know. Me neither.",sad
3449,I mean it's -- this is just this. I mean it includes a lot and everything but isn't something else. Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?,fru
3450,I'm doing the best I can.,xxx
3451,I know that Augie. Really I do.,xxx

3453,Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,sad
3454,I didn't say that.,xxx
3455,"No, I know. But still, I know I don't make you happy.",sad

3457,Yeah?,xxx
3458,Don't be ridiculous. I mean don't you know that?,hap

3460,"Now that you mention it. No, I don't.",hap
3461,"Okay.  Fine, so we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.",xxx
3462,I don't know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me. Look at the moon - view the moon view I got from here.,hap

3464,What have we got here?,hap
3465,"Augie, you brought refreshments.",xxx

4057,"But I know one thing, mom. We've made a terrible mistake with dad.",neu

4060,"What do you mean, dishonest?",neu
4061,You know Larry's not coming back and I know that too. Why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?,xxx
4062,"What, you're going to argue with him?",fru
4063,"No, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time that he realized that no one believes that Larry's coming back anymore.",fru
4064,You can't tell him that.,fru
4065,We got to tell him that.,fru
4066,We can't. It just won't work.,fru

4068,They do come back.,neu
4069,"I know, but he doesn't know that.",xxx
4070,Three years has been a long time.,xxx
4071,"All right. Just- Sit down, mom. I want to talk to you.",fru

4074,What?,fru
4075,"You know-you know why I asked Annie here, right?",neu
4076,Why?,neu
4077,You know.,neu
4078,"Well, I have an idea, but go on, tell me, what's the story?",xxx
4079,I want to ask her to marry me.,neu
4080,"Well, that's only your business, Chris.",neu
4081,"Come on, you know that's not only my business.",fru
4082,"Well, it is. I mean, what do you want me to do? You're grown up; you know what's going on in your mind.",fru
4083,So it's all right. I'll just go ahead with it.,neu

4087,God. You have such a talent for ignoring things.,xxx
4088,"Yeah, well I ignore what I got to ignore.",fru
4089,And she-she's Larry's girl.,fru
4090,"No, she is not Larry's girl.",xxx
4091,"Well, from your father's point of view she is. I mean, he's still alive. You've got no right to take her.",fru
4092,"If you go on from that point, I don't know where you go.",xxx
4093,"'Cause listen, I'm telling you, I don't know where to go from there. Do you?",fru
4094,"Oh, I don't know.",xxx
4095,What do you want from me?,fru
4096,"Every time I reach out for something I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole entire life, time and time after time.",sad
4097,You're a considerate fella and there's nothing wrong in that.,neu
4098,To hell with that.,ang
4099,There's nothing wrong with it.,neu
4100,I didn't ask Annie yet.,neu
4101,You didn't ask her yet?,fru
4102,I wanted to get this settled first.,neu
4103,"Well, how do you know she's going to marry you? I mean, what if she feels the same way as your father?",xxx
4104,Well then I guess it's over then. But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.,neu
4105,"I'll find out. But then after it's all over we'll thrash it out with dad, right?",neu
4106,"Mom, don't avoid me.",fru
4107,"You know, the trouble is you've never had enough women. No, you never did.",fru
4108,So what? I'm not fast with women.,fru
4109,I don't understand why it has to be her.,fru
4110,Because it is.,neu
4111,"That's a good answer, but it doesn't answer anything.",fru
4112,I just-,fru
4113,"I mean, you haven't seen her since the war. I mean, it's been five years.",fru
4114,It just is. I-,neu
4115,"I grew up with her. Okay. All these years, when I think of someone I want to be my wife I think of Annie. What do you want, a diagram?",fru
4116,"No, I don't want a diagram.",fru
4117,"He thinks he's coming back. You go-go on and marry her, I mean, you're pronouncing her dead. And what's going to happen to your father, huh? I don't know. Do you?",fru
4118,"Okay. All right, then.",fru
4119,"Just, listen. Give it more thought, is all.",fru
4120,"No, I've given it three years of thought.",fru
4121,And I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,xxx
4122,But if I can't have that here then I'll get out.,neu
4123,What the hell is this?,xxx
4124,I'll get out. I'll marry her somewhere else. Maybe New York.,neu
4125,You're crazy.,xxx
4126,I've been a sucker too long. I'm through with it.,xxx
4127,You're what-you're going to leave the business? But you can't do that. What the hell is this?,fru
4128,The business. The business doesn't inspire me.,fru
4129,"Oh, you have to be inspired.",fru
4130,Yes. I like it an hour out of the day. If I have to grub for money all day long at least that evening I want it beautiful. I want a wife. I want a family. I want some kids. I want to build something I can give myself to.,ang
4131,"Now, Annie's in the middle of all that.",ang
4132,"Now, where do I find it?",neu
4133,Tell me something.,neu
4134,You'd leave that business.,neu
4135,Yes. On this I would.,neu
4136,You can't do that.,fru
4137,Then help me stay here.,neu
4138,"All right, but you can't do that. You can't talk like that.",fru
4139,Okay. Just-,neu

4141,"Yeah, I know, I know, just help me stay here, all right?",fru
4142,I'm going to.,neu
4143,You just can't talk like that.,xxx
4144,I am thinking like that.,neu

4147,Yeah. I can see that.,neu
4148,Why did you invite her here?,ang
4149,Why? Does that bother you?,xxx
4150,She's been in New York for three-and-a-half years. She don't just suddenly come and-,ang
4151,"Well, maybe, maybe he just wanted to see her.",neu
4152,You don't travel seven hundred miles just to see.,ang
4153,"What do you mean? They lived next door to each other their entire lives. Why shouldn't he want to see her? Hey, don't look at me like that. I don't know anymore than you do.",xxx
4154,He's not going to marry her.,xxx
4155,How do you know he's even thinking about it?,neu
4156,It's got that about it.,ang

4159,"Listen, kid-",fru
4160,She's not Larry's girl. She knows that.,ang
4161,You can't read her mind.,neu
4162,Then why is she married? Then why isn't she married? She's been in New York and there's hundreds of single men there.,xxx
4163,"I'm sure hundreds of them asked her and told her that she's foolish, but no.",xxx
4164,She's waited.,xxx
4165,How do you know why she's waited?,neu
4166,"Because she thinks like me, that's why.",xxx
4167,"She's faithful as a rock, don't you know. In my worst moments I can think of her-",sad
4168,"I think again, that I'm-I'm right.",xxx
4169,"Look, it's a nice day. What are we arguing for?",neu
4170,"Nobody in my house better ever dare-dare to challenge her faith. Maybe strangers, but not his father, not his brother.",ang
4171,Calm yourself.,neu
4172,Because he's not coming back. Then what do I got to live for? I'll kill myself.,xxx
4173,Calm yourself.,fru
4174,"Don't, don't laugh at me, don't laugh at me.",ang

4176,All right. All right. Calm yourself.,ang

4255,"I mean, that's-that's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had. They didn't just die. They killed themselves for each other. And I mean that exactly. A little more selfish and they'd still be here today.",sad
4256,"And I, and I thought something watching them go down.",sad
4257,"Everything was being destroyed, see, but there was one new thing that was being created. A kind of responsibility, man for man. You understand me?",sad
4258,And to show that-to bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him.,sad
4259,And I came back here and it was incredible. There was no meaning in that here. The whole thing to them was a bus accident.,sad
4260,And I went to work with dad and that rat race again. And I felt what you said-ashamed somehow. Because nobody was changed at all. It seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys.,sad
4261,"And I felt wrong to be alive. To drive the car, to see the new checkbook, to see the new refrigerator. I mean, you can take those things out of the war. But you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man. And you got to be a little bit better because of that.",sad
4262,"Otherwise, what you have here is loot; and there's blood on it.",sad
4263,And I didn't want to take any of it.,sad
4264,And I guess that included you.,sad
4265,And you still feel that way?,sad
4266,"I want you now, Annie.",xxx
4267,"Because you can't feel that way, never again, Chris. You hear me? Never. I mean, the money and me too.",sad

4275,Fine.,sad
4276,"Oh, is that-is that-now, is that just foam, uhh, I can't even tell.",exc
4277,"Oh, though if I can't tell it probably isn't them, right? It probably would be unmistakable, wouldn't you think? Hey, how you doing?",exc
4278,"Oh, do you know what I forgot? I forgot my flashlight. How could I be so stupid. Oh, I-I should have brought my flashlight.",exc
4279,What flashlight?,xxx
4280,"Uh- you know, the flashlight. The silver one. There's only one, isn't there?",exc
4281,That's not your flashlight; it's ours. It's mine too.,xxx
4282,"Oh, well, sure.",xxx

4285,We should have brought our flashlight. I can't believe we forgot to bring it.,exc
4286,I hope the moon stays out.,exc

4288,Yes.,xxx
4289,Are you cold? Do you want my jacket?,xxx
4290,"We should have brought the blanket. Oh, why didn't we bring the blanket? Our blanket.",exc

4292,I'm so stupid. I'm like a little kid. I-it's amazing I get out of the house with my fly zipped. Oh- [LAUGHTER].,exc
4293,I wonder if they can hear us talk. Or hear the vibrations in the sand when we move.,exc
4294,I'm cold.,xxx
4295,Do you want my jacket?,neu
4296,"It's past eleven, let's go home.",xxx
4297,What? Are you kidding me? We just got here. We'd miss it. What's the point of coming down there if we just turn around and go home?,sur
4298,There is no point in coming down here.,xxx
4299,Right.,neu
4300,That's my point.,xxx
4301,"Yeah, that's my point too.",neu
4302,"Well, so let's go.",xxx
4303,"No. No, no, no, that's not my point. My point is there's no point in coming down here if we just turn around and leave.",exc

4305,Not particularly.,sad
4306,Why not?,neu
4307,I don't know. I just don't.,sad
4308,"Honey, this is a natural-this is a natural phenomenon. I mean, it only happens once a year. This is, this is a great opportunity. Think about the people in Kansas. They would have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservation to come and see this. We're only forty minutes away. This is too good to pass up.",xxx
4309,Pass up what? A bunch of fish. They swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die.,ang
4310,Yeah. But that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives. And all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you-spawning or mating or something like that.,xxx
4311,"I mean, this is the big night for these guys. Life's last orgy.",xxx
4312,"I don't know why you're getting so excited. I mean, it's not like the landing of the moon or something. It's just fish. Fish that nobody eats.",fru
4313,"Yeah, they do.",xxx
4314,"Oh, God, Augie.",fru
4315,"What, okay, then it's fish that do something no other fish do. Like the swallows in Capistrano or the lemmings who throw themselves off the cliffs.",xxx

4318,For real?,sur
4319,Yes.,xxx
4320,I don't get it. The last time-the first time that we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life.,xxx
4321,And then last year when we came to see it you ran out of the house so fast that you stubbed your toe. And you didn't even notice until you got in the car.,xxx
4322,"Yes, and if you also remember, I got sand in my panties. We got into an argument about nothing. You got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions.",fru
4323,We weren't in a good spot.,xxx
4324,"No, for God's sakes, we've never seen the grunions. We're not going to see them.",fru
4325,"We just weren't in a good spot, all right? This is a much better spot. I have a good instinct for these things. Look, is that-",fru
4326,"no, that's just seaweed, isn't it? This is great, isn't it?",xxx
4327,"I wouldn't miss this for anything. I mean, think about this. Okay, I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.",exc
4328,Somewhere out there there's this huge silver mass of fish heading this way. They don't know why. And we don't know why. Just some little instinctual time-release firecracker went off-went off in their bodies.,xxx
4329,"And they all, all as one, turned as one and formed this line as big as the California coast and started swimming this way. Swimming as if that's the only thing that matters.",exc
4330,"You know, they didn't ask it a question. They didn't, they didn't take a vote. They didn't have an invitation or a map; they just started swimming as one.",exc
4331,"its single-mindedness with one mind. Urgency that's pure urge. You know, they don't give it a name.",exc
4332,"They don't ask it a question. They just, they just, they don't know what drives them. They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here",exc
4333,"where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death. Oh, God, I'm giving myself goosebumps. Look, I'm all-all my hairs on my arms is sticking up.",exc
4334,"Yeah, that's the wind.",xxx
4335,So what do you think?,xxx
4336,About what?,xxx
4337,About what I just said.,neu
4338,It's ridiculous.,xxx
4339,So what do you think?,xxx
4340,About what?,neu
4341,About what I was just saying.,neu
4342,It's ridiculous.,xxx
4343,It certainly is not. It is slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,fru
4344,"It's so P.R. I mean, somebody's giving you a good bill about this wonderful event that's going to happen on the beach.",xxx
4345,"Well, I'm not the only one. Look at all these people.",fru
4346,Exactly. Everyone else is told the same thing. It keeps them feeling excited. Keeps them coming back. Keeps them thinking life's going to start at any minute now.,xxx
4347,Are we talking about the same thing?,fru
4348,I don't care. It's still fish to me.,xxx
4349,"Carla, can I ask you something? Don't take this wrong, but are you having your period?",neu
4350,"Augie, Goddamn it, don't ask me that. You always ask me that. Why do you ask me that? I hate it. It's insulting.",ang

4352,"Look, it's-we just-we're looking at this evening in a different way, both of us. We both have different ideas of it.",fru

4354,It's not like that.,xxx
4355,We're not seeing the grunions?,neu

4358,Twice is as many times as we've tried. That's ever.,xxx
4359,We'll see them this time.,fru
4360,"No, we won't.",xxx
4361,"It's impossible. It's like waiting around. Waiting to see Santa Claus, you know?",xxx
4362,Like I feel like my whole life I've been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up.,ang
4363,"God, I thought you wanted to see it.",fru
4364,I do.,fru
4365,"Look, I did. I always do. But it's like every time I try nothing ever happens.",fru
4366,It's just fish. Nothing to get traumatized over.,fru
4367,"For God's sake, Augie, this is not about fish.",fru
4368,"I've been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse, and I can't seem to pinpoint it.",fru
4369,"You were fine during the phone call from Marge. Dinner was okay. Doing the dishes was no problem. Let's see. I took a shower. You were watching the news. You said Augie, I think the grunion are running. I said great, let's go. I feel lucky tonight.",fru
4370,"And so I'm getting the animals, putting the animals out in the yard. I'm putting on my jacket, getting the car out of the garage-",fru

4372,We thought I was pregnant.,sad
4373,You brought a bottle of champagne.,sad
4374,We took off our shoes and we danced barefoot in the sand. Under the moon.,hap
4375,And you whispered so intimately in my ear so I could feel your words.,hap
4376,"Oh, that moment-that was it.",hap
4377,"I told myself finally, this is how happy I'm supposed to be.",sad
4378,Wait a minute. I got it.,neu
4379,Dancing barefoot in the sand. Drinking out of a bottle of champagne.,hap
4380,"It was driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, right? You said let's get some champagne, and I said time's-a-wasting or something like that.",xxx
4381,"You want this to be like the other time, right? That's it. Right?",xxx
4382,I don't want to remember something.,sad

4387,No.,sad
4388,Take off our shoes?,xxx

4393,No.,fru
4394,No.,ang
4395,A vacation?,fru
4396,No.,fru
4397,A new carpet? A poodle?,fru

4399,I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.,fru
4400,"Jesus, welcome to the human race.",fru
4401,Did you think this is how I thought it was going to turn out? Do you think I had some great fantasy down the line? That four years down the line that we'd come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?,xxx
4402,"No, I was just like you. I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great. And the wind in our hair and the sand in our toes, and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves, and we'll have three big fat rosy kids. And oh God.",fru
4403,"You know what you get? The jokes on us, baby. Because do you know what you get? Huh? Carla? Do you know what you get? You get this.",fru
4404,This what? What is this? This is nothing.,fru
4405,"Yes, it is.",fru
4406,"No, it's not. It's standing on the beach waiting and fighting.",ang
4407,Right.,fru
4408,Things have never turned out anything the way that I thought they would be.,sad
4409,"No, I know. Me neither.",fru

4411,it's not something else. Do you know what I'm trying to say?,sad

4414,"Yeah, maybe if you were with someone else too.",fru
4415,I didn't say that.,sad

4418,Yeah?,sur
4419,"God, don't you know that? I mean, you're the one that probably wants to be with somebody else. Somebody that didn't take herself so seriously, could enjoy herself more.",fru
4420,"Actually now that you mention it, no, I don't.",hap
4421,"Well, I guess we're just in the wrong spart-spot with the right person.",hap
4422,"Seemed like a pretty good spot to me. I mean, look at the view of the moon we've got from here.",hap
4423,I noticed that. It's beautiful.,hap
4424,You can see right over the water.,hap
4425,"God, big old white moon.",xxx
4426,Look what we got here.,hap
4427,You brought refreshments?,xxx
4428,It's not champagne.,hap
4429,At least we won't need glasses.,hap

4455,"You mean that sacred and beautiful thing, love?",xxx
4456,"Yes, meaning just that.",xxx
4457,What does it all mean? That's what I ask myself in my quest for ultimate truth. What does it all mean?,xxx

4459,"[LAUGHTER]. You mustn't be serious, my dear one, that's what they want.",exc
4460,Who's they?,xxx
4461,All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable. Laugh at them. Be flippant. Laugh at all the sacred shibboleths. Flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,xxx
4462,"Well, if I laugh at everything I'm going to have to laugh at us too.",xxx
4463,"Ooh, certainly you must. We're figures of fun, all right.",exc
4464,"So how long is it going to last? This ludicrous, overbearing love of ours?",xxx
4465,Who knows?,xxx
4466,Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,xxx
4467,No. The fire will fade along with our passion.,xxx
4468,"Oh dear, well, shall we want that?",sad
4469,Depends on how well we play it.,xxx
4470,"Well, what if happens if one of us is to die? Does the one that's left still laugh?",sad
4471,"Yes, yes. Yes, he must with all his might.",xxx
4472,"Well, that's serious enough.",xxx
4473,"No. No, it isn't. Death's very laughable. A cunning little mystery. All done with mirrors.",xxx
4474,"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",xxx
4475,So is everyone else in the long run. Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.,xxx
4476,"Let's blow strumpets, blow-blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like small quite idiotic school children. Let's savor the delight of the moment. Come, kiss me darling, before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.",exc

4480,Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,exc
4481,Which particular one?,xxx
4482,The one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed.,xxx
4483,Oh Charles. That was his name. Charles. He did wiggle so beautifully.,hap
4484,Horrible little thing. I hated it.,xxx
4485,I know you did. You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal. I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,xxx
4486,How long did that row last?,xxx
4487,It went on intermittently for days.,xxx
4488,The worst one was in Cannes when your-your curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown.,xxx
4489,"Well, I burnt a hole in my comb too, and all the towels in the bathroom. [LAUGHTER].",xxx
4490,yeah. And that was the first time you ever hit me.,hap

4492,The manager came in and found us rolling on the floor and biting and scratching like panthers. [LAUGHTER],hap

4494,I know. Oh man. Couldn't believe it.,exc
4495,"Oh, I will never forget his face. Ooh-rah [LAUGHTER].",xxx
4496,We were very much younger then.,xxx
4497,"Yeah, and very much sillier.",xxx
4498,"Oh, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",xxx
4499,"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",ang
4500,You knew there was nothing in that.,xxx
4501,I knew nothing of the sort. You took presents from him.,ang
4502,Presents? It was only a small trivial little broach.,xxx
4503,I remember it well. Bristling with diamonds. In the worst possible taste.,ang
4504,Not at all. It was very pretty. And I wear it all the time. I still have it.,xxx
4505,You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,xxx
4506,"No, I didn't. You made that up all in your jealous imagination.",xxx
4507,You must admit that he was in love with you.,xxx
4508,"Just a little perhaps, but it was nothing serious.",neu
4509,You let him kiss you. You said so.,ang
4510,"Well, what of it?",xxx
4511,What of it?,xxx
4512,"Oh come on, it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't harm me.",xxx
4513,What about me?,ang
4514,"Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you'd have never known anything about it.",xxx
4515,"That's a nice point of view, I must say.",ang
4516,"Well, it's true.",neu
4517,Are you bored with this conversation?,neu
4518,"I definitely, most definitely am.",xxx
4519,So am I. Bored stiff. Want some brandy?,neu
4520,"No, thanks.",xxx
4521,"I'll have a little, I think.",neu
4522,I don't see why you want it; you've already had two glasses.,xxx
4523,"No particular reason. Anyhow, they were very small ones.",neu
4524,I don't see what's the point of going on and on about something like this.,xxx
4525,"Oh, my-you can hardly call three minute liquor glasses in the evening going on and on and on.",xxx
4526,It's become a habit with you.,neu
4527,You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want some yourself at the moment.,ang
4528,Don't be so stupid.,ang
4529,"Really, Amanda.",ang
4530,What?,ang
4531,Nothing.,ang
4532,"Going somewhere, dear?",ang
4533,No. Just making myself fascinating for you.,xxx
4534,That reply has broken my heart.,xxx
4535,"It's a woman's job to allure the man. Watch me, won't you, a minute?",neu
4536,"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",xxx
4537,"No, it isn't.",ang
4538,"Yes, it is.",ang
4539,"No, it's not. I don't care.",xxx
4540,It's a pity you didn't have more brandy. It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,xxx
4541,"Well, it didn't seem to do such wonders with you, now did it?",xxx
4542,"Oh, snap, snap, snap, like a little adder.",xxx
4543,"Adders don't snap, they sting.",fru
4544,"Yes, they do. They have a big bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.",xxx
4545,They sting.,fru
4546,They snap.,ang

4548,"Uhh,",xxx
4549,did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,ang
4550,"Yes, I did, quite a lot actually.",xxx
4551,"I imagine that you let him kiss you quite a bit more then, didn't you?",ang
4552,Mind your business.,fru
4553,You had a riotous-must have had a riotous time. No restraint at all. Very enjoyable. You never had much anyhow.,ang
4554,You are quite insufferable. I suppose it's because you're drunk.,ang
4555,I'm not in the least bit drunk.,ang
4556,You've always had a weak head.,fru
4557,"Okay. As I mentioned before, I said I had three very minute liquor glasses. That's hardly enough to get a child of two drunk.",ang
4558,"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",xxx
4559,"Oh, very interesting indeed. How about a child of four or a child of six or a child of nine. We might have a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.",xxx
4560,Do shut up. Shut up.,fru
4561,I don't want to talk about this anymore.,fru
4562,You better turn that off.,xxx
4563,Why?,xxx
4564,It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs.,xxx
4565,There aren't any people upstairs. It's a photographer's studio.,xxx

4567,They're away in Tunis.,xxx
4568,This is no time of the year for Tunis.,neu

4570,"No, I will do no such thing.",xxx
4571,Turn it on.,ang
4572,No.,xxx
4573,You've always had far too temperamental for yourself. You should try to control it.,xxx
4574,Turn it off.,ang
4575,I will not. Go away. Go away. I hate you.,ang

5245,"Why shouldn't he walk around and dream at him at night.  Walk around.  Why shouldn't he walk around?  Why shouldn't he dream of him, walk around at night waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say flat out that we don't have anymore hope?",ang
5246,That we haven't had any hope for years now?,ang
5247,You can't say that to him.,xxx
5248,We got to say it to him.,xxx
5249,How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?,fru
5250,Larry's been gone for three years.  For god sakes no one comes back after three years.  It's insane.,fru
5251,"To you maybe, to me, but not to your father.  I mean,",xxx
5252,he still thinks he's alive still.  I mean you could talk yourself blue in the face and there's no body and there's no grave so where are you?,fru
5253,"Listen mom, just, sit down.  I want to talk to you.",fru
5254,No.  It's his god damned newspapers is what it is.  Now every month there's a new boy comes home and Larry's going to be the next one.,ang
5255,Alright. Alright. Alright just listen.,fru
5256,"You know why I asked Annie here, right?",neu
5257,Why?,ang
5258,You know.,xxx
5259,Well I have an idea but I don't know.  What's the story?,xxx
5260,I want to ask her to marry me.,neu
5261,Well that's your business Chris.,xxx
5262,You know it's not just my business.,fru
5263,"Well what do you want me to do?  I mean, you're old enough to know your own mind.",ang
5264,Okay.  So then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.,neu
5265,"Well, I mean, you got to make sure your dad's not going--",neu
5266,Oh see then it's just not my business. God you infuriate me sometimes.  Isn't my business too if dad throws a fit?  Huh?  God you have such a talent for ignoring things.,ang
5267,Well I'm just saying--,fru
5268,You know I ignore what I got to ignore.,xxx
5269,She's not...she's Larry's girl.,xxx
5270,She's not Larry's girl.,fru
5271,From your father's point of view he is still alive and if you try and take her that's just not fair.  You can't do that.,fru
5272,I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want I have to pull back,fru
5273,"And-And-And if you go on from there if you know already to go on from there, then you can.  But I'm telling you something that I don't know where to go.  You got it?  I mean, do you?",fru

5279,I wanted to get this settled first.,neu
5280,And what if she doesn't marry you huh?  What if she feels the same way your father does?,xxx
5281,Then I guess that's the end of it.,neu
5282,But from her letters I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.,sad
5283,"And then we'll thrash it out with dad right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",neu

5285,Well so what?  I'm just not fast with women.,xxx
5286,Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,fru
5287,Because it is.,fru
5288,"Well that's a good answer but, it doesn't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you left to go to the war and it's been five years.",xxx
5289,It's just...that's just the way it is.  That's how I feel.  You know these years when I think of someone I want to marry I think of Annie.  What do you want a diagram?,fru
5290,No I don't want a diagram.,fru
5291,"He thinks he's coming back. And you go off and marry that girl and you're just pronouncing him dead and what's going to happen to him?  I don't know.  Do you?  I mean, I don't know.",fru
5292,Alright then.,fru
5293,"Look, just give it some thought okay?",xxx
5294,I've given it three years of thought and I thought that if I waited then dad would forget about Larry and then we could have a regular wedding and everything happy.,sad
5295,But if I can't have that here I'll get out.,neu
5296,What the hell is this?,xxx
5297,I'll get out.  I'll marry her somewhere else.  Maybe New York.,neu
5298,Are you crazy?,xxx
5299,I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker and I'm through with it.,ang
5300,You're just going to leave the business?  You have a business here.  You can't do that.,ang
5301,The business doesn't inspire me.,ang
5302,"Oh, you have to be inspired.",xxx
5303,Yes.  I like it an hour out of the day.  If I have to grub for money all day long at least at evening I want it beautiful.  I want a family.  I want a wife.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.,ang
5304,Now Annie is in the middle of all that.  Where do I find it?,fru
5305,Tell me something.  You can leave this business?,sad
5306,Yes.  On this I would.,neu
5307,You can't talk like that.,xxx
5308,Then help me stay here.,xxx

5321,Nobody travels seven hundred miles just see.,xxx
5322,uh-uh What do you mean?  They grew up next to each other their entire lives.  Why shouldn't he want to see her?,fru
5323,Hey don't look at me like that.  I don't know anymore than you.,fru
5324,He's not going to marry her.,xxx
5325,Who said he even thought about that?,neu

5329,Now listen kid...,fru
5330,No.  She's not his girl Joe and she knows that.,ang
5331,You can't read her mind.,xxx

5341,I want-I want you to act like he's still alive.  I mean don't think I haven't seen the way that you've been since he invited her here.,xxx
5342,But Kate...,fru
5343,But I won't have any of this nonsense because you know what happens?  If he doesn't come back I'll kill myself.,xxx
5344,"Laugh, laugh at me but I will.  Because you know what happened when she came here?  When she came back she slept in his room, the memorial broke into pieces. Joe, look. Look at it. You got to believe with me.",ang
5345,Okay. Calm yourself. Just calm yourself.,fru
5346,I can't do it all alone.,xxx

5557,Take off our shoes?,fru
5558,No.,fru
5559,What?  Do you want me to breathe in your ear?,fru
5560,No.,fru
5561,Do you want to get married again? What? What?  Do you want a divorce? A vacation? What?  A carpet?  A poodle?  A basket of fruit?  What?  A suicide pact?  What the hell do you want Carla?,xxx
5562,No...No...No...,fru
5563,No...,fru
5564,I want things to turn out the way that they're supposed to be.,ang
5565,Welcome to the human race.,ang
5566,Do you think that this is what I had in mind?  That four years down the line that we'd get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish?  No.,ang
5567,I was just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and we'd have three big fat rosy kids...,ang
5568,...and you know?  Baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get?  Do you know what you get Carla?  You get this.,ang
5569,"This what...what's this?  This isn't anything. Alright.  Sure.  Standing on the beach, fighting and waiting.",fru
5570,Yes it is.,ang
5571,Right.,ang
5572,Cause everything isn't anything like I thought it would be.,ang
5573,No.  I know.  Me neither.,xxx
5574,This is just this.  You know?  I mean it's a lot and everything but it isn't somewhere else.  Do you know what I'm trying to say?,sad
5575,I'm trying to do the best I can.,fru
5576,I know you are Augie.  I know you wanted this evening to be nice.,sad
5577,I can't help thinking about being somewhere else.,sad
5578,Maybe if you were with someone else too.,sad
5579,I didn't say that.,sad
5580,I know.  But I know I don't make you happy.,sad
5581,"Augie, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing with you.",sad
5582,Yeah?,xxx
5583,Yeah.  Don't you know that?,xxx
5584,If anybody wants to be with anybody else it's probably you.  Probably somebody who enjoys herself a little more and is not so hard.,sad
5585,"Actually, now that you mention it, no I don't.",xxx
5586,"Well, I guess this is the wrong spot for the right people.",sad
5587,It seemed like a good spot to me.,xxx
5588,I mean look at the view of the moon we got from here.,hap
5589,Yeah.  I noticed that.  It's real pretty on the water.,hap
5590,Big old white moon.,xxx
5591,"Hey, look what we got here.",hap
5592,Oh you brought refreshments.,hap
5593,It's not champagne.,xxx
5594,Well at least we won't need glasses.,xxx
5595,Are you still cold?  Do you want to go home?,xxx
5596,No I'm beginning to think you might be right.,hap
5597,I think this may be the place for us after all.,hap
5598,I am sorry Augie.,hap
5599,Shh.  If we're very quiet the fish might come.,hap
5600,Or not.,hap
5601,Or not.,hap
5602,Good God.,xxx
5603,Do you think it's them?,xxx
5604,I wonder.,xxx
5605,And nobody knows we're here except for Freda and she wouldn't ring up.,xxx
5606,Well it must be them then.,xxx
5607,What are you going to do?,xxx
5608,We're fine right?  Aren't we?  Whatever happens darling.,xxx
5609,Now and always sweet.,exc
5610,I don't care then.,exc
5611,"I mean, it was, it's bound to come out sooner or later.",exc
5612,Hello?  Hello?  What?,xxx
5613,That sent shivers up my spine.,exc
5614,"No, wrong number.",exc
5615,What are we to do if they suddenly walk in on us?,xxx
5616,Behave exquisitely.,exc
5617,With the most perfect poise?,xxx
5618,Certainly.  And I shall probably do a court courtesy.,xxx
5619,um- Things that should matter dreadfully don't seem to matter at all when one's happy do they?,xxx
5620,What is so horrible is that one cannot stay happy.,xxx
5621,"Oh, darling.  Don't say that.",xxx
5622,"It's true.  I mean, the whole business it's a very poor joke.",xxx
5623,"You mean that, that sacred and beautiful thing love?",xxx
5624,Yes.  I mean just that.,xxx
5625,What does that all mean?  That's what I asked myself on my quest for ultimate truth.  What does it all mean?,xxx
5626,Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,xxx
5627,"[LAUGHTER] Oh, darling.  You mustn't be serious, that's just what they want.",xxx
5628,Who's they?,xxx
5629,All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.  Laugh at them.  Be flippant.,xxx
5630,Laugh at all their sacred shibboleths.  Flippancy brings the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,xxx
5631,So if I'm to laugh at everything then I must laugh at us too.,xxx
5632,"Oh, certainly, you must.  We're figures of fun alright.",xxx
5633,How long will it last?  This ludicrous overbearing love of ours?,xxx
5634,Who knows?,xxx
5635,Shall we always want to bicker and fight?,xxx
5636,No.  That fire will fade along with our passion.,xxx
5637,"Well, dear, shall we want that?",xxx
5638,"Well, it depends on how well we've played.",xxx
5639,"What happens if one of us dies?  I mean, does the other one still laugh?",xxx
5640,"Of course, yes, yes, with all his might.",xxx
5641,That's serious enough.,sad
5642,"No.  No it isn't.  That's very laughable, a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors.",xxx
5643,Darling I believe you're talking nonsense.,xxx
5644,"Oh, and who isn't talking nonsense?",xxx
5645,Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers hmmm?  Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and party as much as we can like quite idiotic school children.,xxx
5646,Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come kiss me darling before worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,xxx
5647,"Elliot, worms don't pop.",xxx
5648,"I don't care what you do, you see?  As long, no I don't care what you do, see?",xxx
5649,You can put green paint all over your body and dance naked in the Place Vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.,xxx
5650,Thank you dear.  The same applies to you...,xxx
5651,...only if you ever so much as look at another woman I'll kill you.,xxx
5652,Remember that awful scene we had in Venice?,xxx
5653,Which particular one?,xxx
5654,The one when you bought a little painted wooden snake in the Piazza and put it in my bed.,xxx
5655,"Charles, that was his name, Charles.  Oh, God he was so wiggled so beautifully.",xxx
5656,Horrible little thing.,xxx
5657,Yeah.  I know you did.  You threw it out the window and into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.,xxx
5658,I hated it.,xxx
5659,How long did that rile last?,xxx
5660,It went on intermittently for days.,xxx
5661,"Oh, the worst one was in Cannes when you-",xxx
5662,I burnt a hole in my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,xxx
5663,you're curling iron burnt a hole in my dressing gown.,xxx
5664,That was a rouser wasn't it?,xxx
5665,[LAUGHTER] Yeah.  That was the first time you ever hit me.,xxx
5666,I didn't hit you very hard.,neu
5667,"The manager came in and saw us rolling on the floor, scratching and biting like panthers.",xxx
5668,I will never forget his face. Ooh-rah [LAUGHTER].,xxx
5669,"How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",xxx
5670,We were very much younger then.,xxx
5671,And much sillier too.,xxx
5672,The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.,xxx
5673,Yes.  The real cause of that rile was Peter Burden.,neu
5674,"Oh, come on, you knew there was nothing in that.",neu
5675,I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,xxx
5676,Presents?  A trivial little broach.,ang
5677,Mmm Hmm.  I remember it well.  Bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.,xxx
5678,Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.,xxx
5679,You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,ang
5680,No I didn't.  You made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination.,neu
5681,You must admit he was in love with you.,ang
5682,Just a little perhaps but nothing serious.,neu
5683,You let him kiss you. You said so.  What of it?,ang
5684,Well what of it?,xxx
5685,"Well it didn't harm him, in fact, it pleasured him a lot and it didn't hurt me.",neu
5686,And what about me?,ang
5687,"Well, if you hadn't been so suspicious and nosey you would've never known anything.",xxx
5688,"Oh, that's a nice point of view I must say.",ang
5689,"Look, I'm bored with this conversation.",xxx
5690,"Yeah, so am I.  Bored stiff.",ang
5691,You want some brandy?,neu
5692,No thanks.,xxx
5693,I'll have a little I think.,neu
5694,I don't know why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,ang
5695,No particular reason.  Anyhow they were very small ones.,ang
5696,I don't see what you have to go on and on with this kind of thing.,ang
5697,Oh my...just because I just...okay...,ang
5698,...having three small minute liquor glasses in the evening is hardly going on and on and on.,xxx
5699,It's become a habit with you.,neu
5700,You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any yourself at the moment.,ang
5701,Don't be so stupid.,xxx
5702,Really Amanda.,fru
5703,What?,ang
5704,Nothing.,fru
5705,[BREATHING],xxx
5706,Going out somewhere dear?,fru
5707,"No, just making myself beautiful for you.",neu
5708,That reply has broken my heart.,xxx
5709,That's the woman's job to lure the man.  Watch me a moment won't you?,neu
5710,Actually that's perfectly true.,neu
5711,No it isn't.,xxx
5712,Yes it is.,neu
5713,"Oh, be quiet.",xxx
5714,I think you should have some more brandy...,xxx
5715,I think that,neu
5716,...cause really,xxx
5717,it doesn't seem to be working on you.,xxx
5718,"perhaps maybe you should've had more brandy, it might've made you a little less disagreeable.",xxx
5719,Well it really hasn't worked wonders with you.,xxx
5720,"Hmm, snap, snap, snap like a little adder.",xxx
5721,"Adders don't snap, they sting.",ang
5722,Yes they do.  They have a bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,xxx
5723,They sting.,ang
5724,They snap.,fru
5725,I don't care.  I don't care.  Do you understand?  I don't care if they roll around and bark like hoops.,xxx
5726,Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,xxx
5727,"Yes, I did.  Quite a lot.",xxx
5728,I suppose you let him kiss you a great deal more then?,xxx
5729,Mind your business.,ang
5730,"Mmm, you must've had a riotous time.  No restraint at all, very enjoyable.  You never had much anyhow.",xxx
5731,You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.,ang
5732,I'm not in the least bit drunk.,ang
5733,You've always had a weak head.,ang
5734,"Okay, like I mentioned before I had three very small, minute liquor glasses of brandy.  That's not even enough to get a child of two drunk.",ang
5735,"On the contrary, a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy.",ang
5736,"Oh, what an interesting topic.  What about a child of four and a child of six?  A child of nine?",ang
5737,Shut up.,ang
5738,We might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots.,ang
5739,"Not very funny dear.  In fact, maybe you better have some more brandy.",ang
5740,"Oh, thanks.  I think I will.",ang
5741,You better turn that off.,ang
5742,Why?,xxx
5743,Because people upstairs will get annoyed.,xxx
5744,There aren't any people upstairs.  This is a photographer's studio.,xxx
5745,Well there are people downstairs I suppose.,xxx
5746,They are away in Tunis.,neu
5747,"Oh, this is no time to be in here for Tunis.",xxx
5748,"Turn it on again, please.",fru
5749,No I'll do no such thing.,ang
5750,Very well.  If you insist on being a boorish and idiotic.,ang
5751,"Come on, turn it off.  It's driving me mad.",ang
5752,You are far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,ang
5753,Turn it--Turn it off.,ang
5754,Go away.  Go away.  I hate you.,ang
5755,Very amusing indeed.,ang
5756,"I hate you.  Listen I'm sick and tired of listening to you, you sadistic bully.",ang
5757,"You know what?  You're a vile, little, evil-minded, little, wicked beast and I never want to see you again.",ang
5758,"This is the end.  Understand?  This is the end, here and now, forever and always.",ang
5759,You're not going nowhere. No you're not.,ang
5760,"Oh, yes I am. Yes I am and you can't stop me.",ang
5761,Just shut up.,ang
5762,shut up. shut up.  I would-I would never marry you again if you came crawling back to me on your hands and knees because you're an evil-minded little vampire and I hope to God I never see you again.,ang
5763,"Listen, you're a cruel fiend and I hate, loathe you.  Thank God finally, finally thank God I've realized just how horrible you are--and marry you?  Marry you?  Never. I will never marry you.  I will die die in torment-",ang
5764,Beast. Brute. Cad. Swine. Beast. Beast. Brute. Devil. Sorry.,ang
5765,Oh.,ang
5766,"Hi.  Um, excuse me I've been to, like, five of the desks here and nobody seems to be able to tell me what it is I need to do.  I've been here for over an hour.  Can you possibly help me?",xxx
5767,"Uh, lets- What do you need exactly?",fru
5768,Well I filled out all the forms and I've given them to everyone and they keep sending me to someone else.,fru
5769,"You need a new license, is that what you're telling me?",fru
5770,Yes.  I'm just trying to get a new license.,fru
5771,Let me see the form. Just let me see the form. Yeah.  You filled this out wrong.  I can't - I can't - I can't do anything with this.,fru
5772,Okay.  I did-,fru
5773,Ma'am I cannot help you.  You need to fill out a new form and you need to get in the back of the line.,fru
5774,I did exactly what they told me to do.,ang
5775,I have done everything everyone in this entire place has told me to do.  I've been here for over an hour.  They make me wait in line.  Every single time I start over again.,fru
5776,Ma'am I can't help you.  Do you understand?,fru
5777,I have a life.  I have things to do.  I have places to go.  Can you not just put this through please?,fru

5782,There's nothing I can do for you.  Do you understand that?  Nothing.,ang
5783,"What I need you to do is go to the back of the line,",fru
5784,I've been to the back of the line five times.,ang
5785,fill out this form and wait,fru
5786,You're going to have to go back again.,ang
5787,Okay.  What is it that I did wrong on the form that I have to start all over again?,ang
5788,This whole area here you didn't initial,xxx
5789,and you filled out-,fru
5790,"Okay.  Well, I can do that right here right now without going to the back of the line again.  See look initialed.  All done. Ready to go.",ang

5802,No.  No.  No. No. You have to help me.,xxx
5803,like I said before right now.,ang
5804,This is your job is to help people like me who need to get a new license.,ang
5805,That's like the whole purpose of you being here.,xxx
5806,Ma'am you are testing my patience.  Do you understand me?,fru
5807,I- I- I'm testing your patience?,xxx
5808,You're testing my goddamn patience.,ang
5809,I'm testing your patience?,ang

5826,"I'll believe it, but- I'll believe it but it- I don't know that that's going to happen.",fru
5827,Well you have to have faith because I don't have a choice and I have to go.,sad
5828,You do have a choice.  You don't have to go.,xxx
5829,Do you think I want to leave you?,sad
5830,You have a choice.,fru
5831,I have to do this.  I don't want to leave.  Do you think I want to miss seeing her grow up?,sad
5832,I know.  It's just you don't have to do this for a living you know.,fru
5833,You're a smart person.  There are other things you can do.,fru

5835,And now- and now it's really shitty timing but now I have to go.,sad
5836,I mean I'm the one who has to leave here.  I'm the one who has to leave the two of you.  At least you get to be together.,fru
5837,It's just not going to work out without you here.,xxx
5838,What's that supposed to mean?,sad
5839,I mean we can't-we're not a complete family without you here.,sad
5840,Well I'll come back.  What is that supposed to mean?  You're not willing to wait for me to come back?,ang
5841,Of course I'm going to wait.  I just- I just don't like the idea of this happening because this isn't the last time this is going to happen. You're going to go on more tours and stuff.  I just- I can't-,fru
5842,I can't deal with this emotionally.,fru
5843,What do you want me to do?,fru
5844,I want you to leave.  I want you to leave the service.,fru
5845,Well I can't very well do it today.  I still have to leave tomorrow.,fru
5846,You can do it today.  You don't have to do anything.  You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.,fru
5847,"You're not making this any easier for me, you know.  I'm the one who has to go and you're really not helping.",fru
5848,Look I'm just telling you that you don't have to go.,fru
5849,I do have to go. And I need to know that you're here waiting for me and that you believe that I'm coming back.,fru

6040,Welcome to Northwest Airlines.  How can I help you?,fru
6041,You guys lost my bag.,fru
6042,Did you file a complaint already?,fru
6043,Yeah.  Yeah I did.,fru
6044,Where?  Did you do it at the front desk or by the baggage claims?,fru
6045,"I-I don't know.  The place where they told me to go.  Look they told me to come talk to you because you guys lost my bag.  Not it's late.  Not it will be here soon, lost it completely.  What are you going to do about that?",fru
6046,"Ma'am, first of all I'd like you to calm down.  Second of all-",fru
6047,Look that bag has my entire life in it and you just lost it.,fru
6048,I understand that ma'am.,xxx
6049,"Lost it just, like, I mean,",ang
6050,"Ma'am, I understand that.",fru
6051,it's not like it just disappeared into thin air. Somebody wasn't paying attention,ang
6052,"because my bag was very easy to keep track of.  It's got big, you know, rainbow colored crap all over it and no one was paying attention because now it's just gone.",ang
6053,"I understand that.  The best I can do for you, at this moment, is give you fifty dollar check courtesy of Northwest Airlines for inconveniencing you in losing your luggage.",fru
6054,Wait.  What?,sur
6055,"At this moment in time, all I can do for you is give you-",fru
6056,No. No. I heard- I heard what you said.,ang
6057,"You're kidding me, right.  You're going to give me fifty dollars to completely cover my bag, everything that was in it, the inconvenience that I've gone through.  I paid for my ticket.  All I expect is to safely get to my destination with my stuff.  Is that so much to ask?  I mean I really don't think that's that big a deal to ask you guys to have my bag in the place where I leave and then put my bag where I end up.",ang
6058,you're getting very excited right now,fru
6059,"Yeah, well that's got everything I have in it.",ang
6060,"I understand that, ma'am but there's not really much I can do for you right now.",fru
6061,Look fifty dollars is unacceptable.  My bag itself cost over a hundred and fifty dollars.  You can't just give me fifty dollar gift certificate to Percoes or whatever the hell and then send me off like that's- that's good enough.  Like that's all I needed was fifty dollars.  My bag is worth more than that.,ang
6062,What I need you to do is file another complaint form. There's a form that you can fill out over by the front desk near the baggage claim.,fru
6063,If you'd like to take that over to the front desk- Ma'am.,fru
6064,We're just talking over each other.,fru
6065,We're not going to communicate anything this way.,fru
6066,I expect your airline who was responsible for my bag to give me the equivalent of the bag and all of the things in it.,ang
6067,Ma'am in flying with Northwest Airlines you agreed to,fru
6068,sign away your luggage to the,fru
6069,I didn't sign anything. I didn't sign anything. And you people have got to make-,ang

6071,You have to make amends for what you did for losing my bag and all of my stuff.  Fifty dollars is unacceptable.,ang
6072,"Ma'am, please calm down.  When you purchase a ticket, there is a terms and agreement,",fru
6073,No.  No.  I don't know. You know what? I'm going to call my lawyer. You know what?  That's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to call my lawyer and have him get down here and explain to you that this is an unacceptable option.,ang
6074,terms and conditions- in the agreement of purchasing a ticket. Most people frequently look it over,fru
6075,The best that we can do for you is give you-,fru
6076,Ma'am.,fru
6077,I want to talk to your supervisor.,ang
6078,I am- I am- I am my own supervisor.,fru

6099,Yeah.,sad
6100,It just doesn't seem fair.,sad
6101,"It's not fair but I mean that's, you know, the course of life is that, you know, you meet people and you lose them.",sad
6102,You're okay,sad
6103,Thank you for being here.,sad
6104,You know I think- I think we should celebrate because I think that's what he would have wanted.,sad
6105,[LAUGHTER] You're probably right.  He probably would be pissed if we were all sitting around being upset about it. He'd want us to have a party.,hap
6106,Yeah.,neu
6107,And to drink in his honor. [LAUGHTER],hap
6108,"That's right.  That's right.  I mean he would want us to, you know, celebrate the life that he- that he lived and, you know, enjoy the rest of ours as much as we can.",sad

6339,He was out here when it broke.,xxx
6340,When?,xxx
6341,About four this morning.  I heard it cracking and I woke up and looked out.  He was standing right there when it cracked.,xxx

6346,He cried hard?,xxx
6347,I could hear him right through the floor of my room.,sad
6348,What was he doing out here at that hour?  He's dreaming about him again.  He's walking around at night.,fru
6349,I guess he is.,xxx
6350,He's getting just like after he died.,xxx
6351,What's the meaning in that?,xxx
6352,"I don't know the meaning of this, mom.  But I know one thing you made a terrible mistake with dad.",fru
6353,What?,sur
6354,"Being dishonest with him, that kind of thing always pays off and now it's paying off.",fru
6355,What do you mean dishonest?,xxx
6356,You know that Larry's not coming back and I know it.  Why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him?,ang
6357,"What do you want to do, argue with him?",ang
6358,I don't want to argue with him but it's time that he realizes that Larry's not coming back anymore.,ang
6359,"Why shouldn't he dream of him?  Walk the nights waiting for him?  Do we contradict him?  Do we say straight out that we have no hope anymore, that we haven't had any hope for years now?",xxx
6360,You can't say that to him.,ang
6361,We've got to say it to him.,ang
6362,How are you going to prove it?  Can you prove it?,ang
6363,For God's sake three years.  Nobody comes back after three years.  It's insane.,ang
6364,To you it is and to me but not to him.  You can talk yourself blue in the face but there's no body and no grave so where are you?,ang
6365,Sit down mom.  I want to talk to you.,fru
6366,The trouble is the goddamn newspapers.  Every month some boy turns up from nowhere so the next one is going to be Larry.,ang
6367,"Alright, alright, alright.  Listen. You know why I asked Annie here don't you?",fru
6368,Why?,xxx
6369,You know why.,neu
6370,Well I got an idea but what's the story?,xxx
6371,I'm going to ask her to marry me.,neu
6372,"Well that's only your business, Chris.",neu
6373,You know it's not only my business.,fru
6374,What do you want me to do?  You're old enough to know your own mind.,ang
6375,Then it's alright.  I'll go ahead with it.,fru
6376,Well you want to make sure that father isn't going to-,xxx
6377,Then it isn't just my business.,ang
6378,I'm just saying.,fru
6379,Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?  Isn't it your business too if I tell this to father and he throws a fit about it.,ang
6380,Sometimes you have a- Sometimes you have a talent for ignoring things.,ang
6381,I ignore what I got to ignore. The girl is Larry's girl.,ang
6382,She's not Larry's girl.,fru
6383,"From father's point of view, he's not dead and you have no right to take his girl.",ang
6384,"Now you can go on from there and you know where to go, but I'm telling you I don't know where to go.  See I don't know.  Now what can I do for you?",ang
6385,"I don't know why it is but every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer. My whole bloody life time after time after time.",fru
6386,You're a considerate fellow.  There's nothing wrong in that.,neu
6387,To hell with that.,ang
6388,Did you ask Annie yet?,xxx
6389,I wanted to get this settled first.,sad
6390,How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.,fru
6391,"Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  I'll find out.",fru
6392,"and then we'll thrash it out with dad, right mom.  Don't avoid me.",ang
6393,The trouble is you don't see enough women.  You never did.,fru
6394,So what I'm not fast with women.,ang
6395,I don't see why it has to be Annie.,ang
6396,Because it is.,ang
6397,Well that's a good answer but it don't answer anything.  You haven't seen her since you went to war.  It's been five years.,ang
6398,I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to her.,xxx
6399,"These years when I think of someone for my wife, I think of Annie.  What do you want, a diagram?",sad
6400,"I don't want a diagram.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.",fru
6401,You marry that girl.  You're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know because I don't?,ang
6402,Alright then mom.,xxx
6403,Just give it some more thought.,xxx
6404,"I've given it three years of thought.  I hoped that if I waited, dad would forget about Larry",ang
6405,"and everything would be happy and we would have a regular wedding.  But if that can't happen here, then I'll have to get out.",fru
6406,What the hell is this?,xxx
6407,"I'll get out.  I'll get married and live someplace else, maybe New York.",xxx
6408,Are you crazy?,ang
6409,I've been a good son too long.  A good sucker I'm through with it.,xxx
6410,You've got a business here.  What the hell is this?,ang
6411,"The business, the business doesn't inspire me.",ang
6412,Must you be inspired?,ang
6413,"Yes, I like it an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening I want it beautiful.",fru
6414,I want- I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I give myself to.  Annie is in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?,fru
6415,You mean-tell me something you mean you'd really leave the business?,fru
6416,Yes on this I would.,xxx
6417,Well you don't want to think that way.,xxx
6418,Then you help me stay here.,fru
6419,Alright but don't think that way,ang
6420,"because what the hell did we work for?  This whole shooting match is just for you, Chris.",ang
6421,I know.  Just you help me stay here.,fru
6422,But don't think that way.  You hear me?,ang
6423,I am thinking that way.,xxx
6424,I don't understand you do I?,xxx
6425,No.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,xxx
6426,Yeah.  I can see that.,ang
6427,Why did he invite her?,ang
6428,Why does that bother you?,neu
6429,It's been three years.  Why all of a sudden?,ang
6430,Well maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her again.,neu
6431,Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,fru
6432,What do you mean?  He was brought up next door to the girl his whole life.  Why shouldn't he want to see her again?,xxx
6433,Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.,xxx
6434,She's not going to marry him.,xxx
6435,How do you know he's even thinking about it?,neu
6436,It's got that about it.,xxx
6437,Well so what.,xxx
6438,"What's going on here, Joe?",ang
6439,Listen kid.,fru
6440,"No, line.",ang
6441,"Uh, Then why is she still-she's not his girl, Joe",neu
6442,"She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",ang
6443,You can't read her mind.,neu
6444,Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?,ang
6445,Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish but she's waited.,ang
6446,How do you know why she waited?,fru
6447,Because she knows what I know that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.,ang
6448,"In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.",fru
6449,Look it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?,fru
6450,"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might but not his father, not his brother.",fru
6451,What do you want me to do?,fru
6452,"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",xxx
6453,But Kate-,fru
6454,"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.",fru
6455,"Laugh, laugh at me, but why did that happen the very night she came back?",xxx
6456,"She goes to sleep in his room and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look, look at it.  Joe-",ang

6458,"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand alone.",fru
6459,Calm yourself.,fru

6481,"I knew they would, your mother anyway.",xxx
6482,How did you know?,xxx
6483,From her point of view why else would I come?,xxx
6484,Wouldn't you want to?,xxx

6521,How many?,sad
6522,Just about all.,sad
6523,"Oh, gees.",xxx
6524,It takes a lot of time to toss that off because they weren't just men.,sad

6526,I put them in my pocket. that's only a little thing but these are the kind of guys I had.,sad
6527,They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.,sad

6536,I mean you can take those things out of war but,xxx
6537,"when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've got to be a little better because of that.",sad
6538,Otherwise what you have is really just loot and there's blood on it.  I didn't want to take any of it.,sad
6539,I guess that included you.,sad
6540,And do you still feel that way?,xxx
6541,"I want you now, Annie.",xxx

6547,What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here.  It couldn't be better.,hap
6548,"Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid to miss it.  How you doing?",xxx
6549,Fine.,neu
6550,"Is that, is that-that's just foam isn't it?  I can't even tell",exc
6551,"although if you can't tell, it probably isn't them.  It will probably be unmistakable.  Don't you think?  How you doing?",xxx
6552,"Oh, no you know what I did?  I forgot my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid I forgot my flashlight.",fru
6553,What flashlight?,xxx
6554,"The flashlight, the silver one.  There's only one isn't there?",fru
6555,It's not yours.,fru
6556,Whose is it?,sur
6557,It's ours.  It's mine too.,xxx
6558,Well sure.,fru
6559,You kept saying my flashlight as if it somehow is just yours.  How's that supposed to make me feel?,xxx
6560,"No of course our flashlight, yours and mine, mi flashlight es su flashlight naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?",fru
6561,I hope the moon stays out.  I wonder do they always run during a full moon.  I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?,exc
6562,Yes.,xxx
6563,"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.",neu
6564,"Ah, this is great, isn't it?  I didn't even think to bring a six-pack.  A six-pack would be just the ticket right about now.",hap
6565,I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.,xxx
6566,"Oh, I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around?",xxx
6567,I'm cold.,xxx
6568,Do you want my jacket?,xxx
6569,It's after eleven let's go home.,ang
6570,Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?,fru
6571,There is no point in coming down here.,ang
6572,Right.,fru
6573,That's my point.,fru
6574,That's my point too.,neu
6575,So let's go home.,fru
6576,"No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?",fru
6577,Not particularly.,fru
6578,Why not?,xxx
6579,I just don't.  It's stupid.,ang
6580,Honey this is natural phenomenon.  I mean this only happens once a year.  This is a great opportunity.,fru
6581,Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.,exc
6582,"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around, and then swim away and then they die.",ang
6583,"Yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  All that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you, spawning or mating something like that.",fru
6584,This is the big night for these guys.  Life's last orgy.,exc
6585,What are you so excited about?  This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.,ang
6586,"Yeah, they do.",fru
6587,"Oh, Augie.",fru
6588,Okay but it's fish who do something none of the other fish do,fru
6589,"like the swallows returning to Capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.  There's mystery here and magic",exc
6590,a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you cannot be interested.,fru
6591,I'm just not.,ang
6592,For real?,sur
6593,Yes.,ang
6594,I don't get it.  The first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here.  You stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.,fru
6595,Last year you will also remember our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got in a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the Grunions.,xxx
6596,We weren't in a good spot.,fru
6597,We didn't see them the first time either.,ang
6598,We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.,ang
6599,"I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there. What's that.  Is that?  Is that, is that-no it's just seaweed isn't it.",exc
6600,"Ah, man this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean think about this.  I know you're not interested but just think about this for a minute.",exc
6601,Out there someplace there's this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.,exc
6602,No one sent them a map or an invitation.  Just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one. They turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.,exc
6603,They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.,exc
6604,It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.,exc
6605,They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask question.  They just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place,exc
6606,where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death.,exc
6607,"Ah, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.",exc
6608,That's the wind.,fru
6609,Well so what do you think?,xxx
6610,About what?,ang
6611,What I said.,xxx
6612,It's ridiculous.,ang
6613,"Well, so what do you think?",neu
6614,About what?,xxx
6615,What I said.,xxx
6616,It's ridiculous.,xxx
6617,It certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,xxx
6618,It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,ang
6619,I'm not the only one.  Look at these people.,xxx
6620,"Well sure everybody's told the same story.  It keeps us all coming back for more.  It keeps us all excited, keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action.",xxx
6621,Are we talking about the same thing?,xxx
6622,Well I'm sorry but it's still just fish to me.,xxx
6623,"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way but are you having your period?",xxx
6624,Goddamn it Augie don't ask me that.  You always ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  It's insulting.,ang
6625,Well then what's bugging you?,fru
6626,We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.,ang
6627,"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",fru
6628,"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",ang
6629,Why not?,fru
6630,We totally skipped. Right.,neu
6631,"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do the little fish business.  We go oh, ah look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",xxx
6632,"For heaven's sake, grow up we are not going to see the Grunions.",ang
6633,Why not?,fru
6634,We never do.  Do we have we ever?,ang
6635,We've missed them twice that's not ever.,fru
6636,Twice is every time we've tried that's ever.,ang
6637,We'll see them this year.,fru
6638,"No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Clause.",xxx
6639,"God I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up,",xxx
6640,and the fish won't show up.,ang
6641,I thought you wanted to see it.,fru
6642,You don't understand anything I'm saying.,fru
6643,"No, of course not.",fru
6644,I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is.,fru
6645,It's just a fish.  Nothing to get traumatized over.,fru
6646,"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",xxx
6647,I've been trying to work this backwards but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.  You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.,fru
6648,Let's see I took a shower.  You watched the news.  You said the Grunions are running tonight. I said great let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.,xxx
6649,"Okay.  Uh, so I'm putting on my jacket, putting out the animals.  We're getting the car out of the garage.",xxx
6650,Do you remember the first time we came to see it?  It was about four years ago right after we got married.,xxx
6651,We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes,sad
6652,"and you popped the cork and while we were dancing, you said the softest most intimate things to me",sad
6653,right into my ear so that I could hear them as much as- so that I could feel them as much as hear them.,sad
6654,"And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",sad
6655,Wait a minute.  I've got it.,neu
6656,"Dancing barefoot in the sand, drinking champagne from the bottle.",sad
6657,"It was in the car right.  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker, you said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?",neu
6658,"That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time, right.  That's it.",exc
6659,I would rather not remember some things.  I would rather not hope for some things.,sad
6660,Okay.  Right.  I got it.  Sure.  Of course.  Listen you want to dance?,xxx
6661,No.,neu
6662,You want me to get some champagne?,neu
6663,No.,sad
6664,Take off our shoes?,xxx
6665,No.  No.,fru
6666,Well what?  Want me to breath in your ear?,fru
6667,No.,fru
6668,Want to get married again?,fru
6669,No.,fru
6670,What?  What do you want a divorce?,fru
6671,No.,fru
6672,A vacation?,fru
6673,No.,ang
6674,"A new carpet, a poodle, a backrub, ice cream, a suicide pact.  What?  What?  Carla what the hell do you want?",fru
6675,I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.,xxx
6676,Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind.,xxx
6677,"Do you think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish.",fru
6678,Do you think that I knew that there'd be times when you'd look at me like I'm a used Kleenex and times I would look at you and think holy hell when's the next flight to Alaska.,fru
6679,"No, no I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our",fru
6680,"Sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha, ha baby the jokes on us.  Because you know what you get,",fru
6681,"you know what you get Carla, this.",xxx
6682,"This what, what is this?  This isn't even anything.",ang
6683,Yes it is.,xxx
6684,"Oh, right, sure this is standing on the beach.  This is waiting.  This is fighting.",ang
6685,Right.,xxx
6686,But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,xxx
6687,"No, I know me either.",xxx
6688,"This is just this.  I mean it includes a lot in everything but it's just not, you know, something else.  Do you have any idea what I'm trying to say?",xxx
6689,I'm doing the best I can.,fru
6690,"I know you are, Augie.  Really I do.  I know you wanted this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and all but I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",sad
6691,Maybe if you were with somebody else too.,sad
6692,I didn't say that.,fru
6693,"No, I know but still.  I know I don't make you happy.",sad
6694,"For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing I'd rather be doing it with you.",fru
6695,Yeah?,sur
6696,Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else,fru
6697,somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.,sad
6698,"Actually now that you mention it, no I don't.",neu
6699,Okay.  Fine.  So we're in the wrong spot but we're with the right person.,xxx
6700,I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.,neu
6701,I mean look at the view you've got of the moon from here.,xxx
6702,"Yeah, I noticed that.  Looks pretty on the water doesn't it, big old white moon.",hap
6703,Well look at what we got here.,exc
6704,"Oh, Augie you brought refreshments.",hap
6705,It's not champagne.,neu
6706,Well then I guess we don't need glasses.,hap
6707,You still cold?  Do you want to go home?,xxx
6708,I'm beginning to think you might be right.  I think this may be the spot after all.  Augie I'm sorry.,hap

6710,Or not.,xxx
6711,Or not.,xxx
6712,Good God.,xxx
6713,Do you think it's them?,xxx
6714,I wonder.,fea
6715,Nobody knows we're here except Freda and she wouldn't ring up.,xxx

6717,Well what are we going to do?,xxx
6718,"We'll be alright, darling.  Whatever happens, aren't we?",xxx
6719,Now and always sweet.,xxx
6720,I don't care then.,xxx
6721,It was bound to come sooner or later.,xxx
6722,Hello.  Hello.  What?  Wrong number.,xxx
6723,Ahh.  It sent shivers up my spine.,exc
6724,What shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us?,exc
6725,Behave exquisitely.,exc
6726,With the most perfect poise.,exc
6727,Certainly I shall probably do a court curtsy.,exc
6728,"Things that ought to matter dreadfully don't matter at all when one's happy, do they?",exc
6729,What is so horrible is that one can't stay happy.,xxx
6730,"Don't say that, my darling.",neu
6731,It's true the whole business is very poor joke.,exc
6732,Meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love.,xxx
6733,"Yes, meaning just that.",xxx
6734,What does it all mean?  That's what I asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth.  Dear God what does it all mean?,xxx
6735,Don't laugh at me.  I'm serious.,exc
6736,"You mustn't be serious, my darling.  It's just what they want.",xxx
6737,Who's they?,neu
6738,All the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable.,xxx
6739,"Laugh at them, be flippant, laugh at everything, all their sacred shibboleths",xxx
6740,flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light.,xxx
6741,"If I must laugh at everything, I must laugh at us too.",xxx
6742,Certainly you must.  We are figures of fun alright.,xxx
6743,"Oh, how long will it last, this ludicrous, over-bearing love of ours?",exc
6744,Well who knows?,neu
6745,We always want to bicker and fight.,xxx
6746,No that fire will fade long with our passion.,xxx
6747,"Oh, dear shall we like that?",xxx
6748,It all depends on how well we've played.,xxx
6749,What happens if one of us dies?  Does the one that's left still laugh?,neu
6750,Yes.  Yes.  with all his might.,xxx
6751,"Well that's serious enough, isn't it?",xxx
6752,"No, no it isn't.  Death is very laughable such a cunning little mystery.  All done with mirrors.",xxx
6753,"Darling, I believe you're talking nonsense.",xxx
6754,So is everyone else in the long run.  Let's be superficial and pity the poor philosophers.,xxx
6755,Let's blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can like small quite idiotic little school children.,xxx
6756,Let's savor the delight of the moment.  Come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets.,xxx
6757,"Elliott, worms don't pop.",xxx
6758,"I don't mind what you do, see. you can paint yourself green all over",xxx
6759,and dance naked in the place Place Vendome and rush away with all the men in the world and I shan't say a word as long as you love me best.,xxx
6760,"Thank you, dear.  The same applies to you except that if I catch you so much as looking at another woman, I'll kill you.",exc
6761,Do you remember that awful scene in Venice?,neu
6762,Which particular one?,exc
6763,The one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed.,neu
6764,"Oh, Charles.  That was his name.  Charles he did wriggle so beautifully.",exc
6765,Horrible thing.  I hated it.,neu
6766,"Yes, I know you did.  You threw him out of the window into the Grand Canal.  I don't think I'll ever forgive you for that.",exc
6767,How long did that row last?,neu
6768,It went on intermittently for days.,xxx
6769,The worst one was in Cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown.,neu
6770,It burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom.,exc
6771,"Ah, we were much younger then.  That was a rouser wasn't it?",xxx
6772,That was the first time you ever hit me.,xxx
6773,You didn't hit me- I didn't hit you very hard.,xxx
6774,Then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers.,exc
6775,I shall never forget his face.,xxx
6776,"How ridiculous.  How utterly, utterly ridiculous.",exc
6777,We were very much younger then.,xxx
6778,And very much sillier.,exc
6779,"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",xxx
6780,"As a matter of fact, the real cause of that row was Peter Burden.",neu
6781,"There was nothing in that, you know that.",xxx
6782,I knew nothing of the sort.  You took presents from him.,ang
6783,Presents a trivial little broach.,xxx
6784,I remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste.,xxx
6785,Not at all.  It was very pretty.  I still have it and I wear it often.,xxx
6786,You went out of your way to torture me over Peter Burden.,ang
6787,I did not.  You made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination.,xxx
6788,"You must admit that he was in love with you, wasn't he?",xxx
6789,"Just a little perhaps, nothing serious.",xxx
6790,You let him kiss you.  You said you did.,ang
6791,What of it?,ang
6792,What of it?,ang
6793,It gave him a lot of pleasure and it didn't hurt me.,xxx
6794,What about me?,ang
6795,"If you hadn't been so nosey, you never would have known a thing about it.",xxx
6796,"That's a nice point of view, I must say.",ang
6797,"Oh, dear.  I'm bored with this conversation.",fru
6798,So am I.  Bored stiff.  Want some brandy?,xxx
6799,No thanks.,fru
6800,"I'll have some myself, I think.",neu
6801,I don't see why you want it.  You've already had two glasses.,xxx
6802,No particular reason.  Anyway they were very small ones.,xxx
6803,seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing.,xxx
6804,You can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on.,fru
6805,It's become a habit with you.,ang
6806,You needn't be so grand just because you don't happen to want any at the moment.,xxx
6807,"Oh, don't be so stupid.",ang
6808,"Really, Amanda.",ang
6809,What?,ang
6810,Nothing.,ang
6811,"Going somewhere, my dear?",ang
6812,Just making myself fascinating for you.,fru
6813,"Ah, that reply has broken my heart.",xxx
6814,The woman's job is to allure the man.  Watch me a minute will you.,fru
6815,"As a matter of fact, that's perfectly true.",xxx
6816,"Oh, no it isn't",fru
6817,"Yes, it is.",xxx
6818,"Oh, be quiet.",xxx
6819,It's a pity you don't have anymore brandy.  It might have made you a little less disagreeable.,xxx
6820,It doesn't seem to have worked such wonders with you.,ang
6821,"Snap, snap, snap like a little adder.",fru
6822,Adders don't snap they sting.,ang
6823,Non-sense they have bags of venom behind their fangs and they snap.,xxx
6824,They sting.,ang
6825,They snap.,xxx
6826,"I don't care, okay.  Do you understand?  I don't care.  I don't mind if they bark and roll about like hoops.",ang
6827,Did you see much of Peter Burden after our divorce?,neu
6828,"Yes, I did quite a lot.",ang
6829,I suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then.,xxx
6830,Mind your own business.,ang
6831,"You must have had a riotous time.  No restraint at all, very enjoyable, you never had much anyhow.",xxx
6832,You're quite insufferable.  I expect it's because you're drunk.,ang
6833,I'm not in the least drunk.,ang
6834,You always had a weak head.,ang
6835,I think I mentioned once before that I had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long.  A child of two couldn't get drunk on that.,fru
6836,"On, the contrary.  A child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy.",ang
6837,Very interesting and how about a child of six and a child of four and a child of nine.,xxx
6838,"Oh, shut up.",ang
6839,"They'd get up a splendid little debate about that, you know.  Intemperate tots.",xxx
6840,"Not very funny, dear.  You'd better have some more brandy.",ang
6841,Very good idea.  I will.,ang
6842,You'd better turn that off I think.,xxx
6843,Why?,ang
6844,It's very late and it will annoy the people upstairs.,xxx
6845,There is no one upstairs.  It's a photographer's studio.,ang
6846,There are people downstairs I suppose.,ang
6847,They're away in Tunis.,xxx
6848,This is no time of year for Tunis.,ang
6849,"Turn it on again, please.",xxx
6850,I'll do no such thing.,xxx
6851,Very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic.,ang
6852,Turn it off.  It's driving me mad.,ang
6853,You're far too temperamental.  Try to control yourself.,ang
6854,Turn it off.,xxx
6855,"Go away, go away.  I hate you.",ang
6856,"Amanda, listen.",ang
6857,Listen? Listen indeed.  I'm sick and tired of listening to you.  You damn sadistic bully.,ang
6858,Stop.,ang
6859,Very amusing.,ang
6860,"Stop, stop.  I hate you.  Do you hear?  You're conceited and overbearing and utterly impossible.",ang
6861,"You're a vile tempered, loose living, wicked little beast. And I hope I never see you again as long as I live.",ang
6862,"This is the end do you understand?  The end,",ang
6863,You're not going like this.,ang
6864,finally and forever,ang
6865,"Oh, I am.  Let go of me.",ang
6866,You're not.,ang
6867,"Oh, I hate you. It's a good thing that I found out in time what you're really like. Marry you again?  Never, never, never.",ang
6868,Shut up.  Shut up. I wouldn't marry you again if you came crawling to me on your bended knees.,ang
6869,"You're a mean, evil minded, little tempered witch. I hope to God I never set eyes on you again as long as I live. Whore.",ang
6870,I'd rather die in torment. Beast.  Brute.  Calf swine.,ang
6871,"Yeah, hi.  Um, look, I -- all I'm trying to do right now is renew my license plate.  That's all.  I just need to get one of those little stickers.",neu
6872,Okay.  What's the problem?,neu
6873,"And I've- I've- some lady -- I got in line.  I waited for about two hours um, and, I gave her this form",fru
6874,"that she gave to me earlier. And she said oh, I gave you the wrong one by accident.  So I was hoping I could just fill out a new one, give it to you and sort of skip this whole line business.",fru

7409,Now what can I do for you?,fru

7412,To hell with that.,fru
7413,Did you ask Annie yet?,xxx
7414,I wanted to get this settled first.,neu
7415,How do you know she'll marry you?  Maybe she feels the same way father does.,neu
7416,"Well if she does, then that's the end of it.  From her letters, I think she's forgotten him.  We'll find out.  Then we'll thrash it out with dad. Right, mom?  Don't avoid me.",xxx
7417,"The trouble is, you don't see enough women.  You never did.",neu
7418,So what?  I'm not fast with women.,xxx
7419,I don't see why it has to be Annie.,ang
7420,Because it is.,fru
7421,"Well that's a good answer, but it don't answer anything.  He thinks he's coming back, Chris.  You marry that girl, you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what happens to your father?  Do you know?  Because I don't.",xxx
7422,Line?,fru
7423,"Alright, then, mom.",fru
7424,"Alright, then, mom.  Did we skip something?  No.  Alright, then, mom.",neu

7426,"Yeah, let's keep going.",neu
7427,Just give it some more thought.,neu
7428,I've given it three years' of thought.  I'd hope that if,fru

7436,Must you be inspired?,ang
7437,"Yes.  I like getting an hour a day.  If I have to grub for money all day long, at least at evening, I want it beautiful.",ang
7438,I want a family.  I want some kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to.  Annie's in the middle of that.  Now where do I find it?,xxx
7439,You mean -- tell me something.  You mean you'd really leave the business?,xxx
7440,"Yes, on this I would.",neu
7441,You don't want to think like that.,ang
7442,Then you help me stay here.,neu
7443,"Alright.  But just don't think like that because what the hell did we work for?  That's all for you, Chris.  The whole shooting match is just for you.",ang
7444,I know that.  Just you help me stay here.,fru
7445,"But don't think that way, you hear me?",ang
7446,I am thinking that way.,xxx
7447,"I don't understand you, do I?",xxx
7448,"No, you don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.",fru
7449,"Yeah, I can see that.",xxx
7450,Why did he invite her here?,ang
7451,"Oh, God, line.",neu
7452,Why does that bother you?,neu
7453,"Why does- why, does that bother you?",xxx
7454,"She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why, all of a sudden--",ang
7455,"Well, maybe- maybe he just wanted to see her.",xxx
7456,Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,ang
7457,What do you mean?  He grew up next door to the girl all his life.  Why shouldn't he want to -- why shouldn't he want to see her again?,fru
7458,Don't look at me like that.  He didn't tell me anymore than he told you.,xxx
7459,He's not going to marry her.,ang
7460,How do you know he's even thinking about it?,neu
7461,It's got that about it.,ang
7462,Well so what?,neu
7463,"What's going on here, Joe?",ang
7464,Line.,neu

7466,"Oh.  Now listen, kid.",xxx
7467,"She's not his girl, Joe.  She knows she's not.",ang
7468,You can't read her mind.,xxx
7469,"Then why is she still single?  New York is full of men.  Why hasn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.",ang
7470,How do you know why she waited?,xxx
7471,"Because she knows what I know, that's why.  She's faithful as a rock.  In my worst moments, I think of her waiting and I know, again, that I'm right.",ang
7472,"Look, it's a nice day.  What are we arguing for?",fru
7473,"Nobody in this house dares take her faith away, Joe.  Strangers might, but not his father, not his brother.",ang
7474,What do you want me to do? What do you want?,fru
7475,"I want you to act like he's coming back, both of you.  Don't think I haven't noticed you since he invited her here.  I won't stand for any nonsense.",ang
7476,"But, Kate--",fru
7477,"Because if he's not coming back, I'll kill myself.",ang
7478,Laugh.  Laugh at me.  But why did that happen the very night that she came here?,ang
7479,She goes to sleep in his bed and his memorial breaks in pieces.  Look.  Look at it.  Joe--,ang
7480,Calm yourself.,fru
7481,"Believe with me, Joe.  I can't stand all alone",ang
7482,Calm yourself.,fru
7483,"Only last week, a man turned up in Detroit missing longer than Larry.",xxx
7484,"Alright, alright.  Calm yourself.",fru

7486,Why me above all?,fru

7491,You're the only one I know who loves his parents.,xxx
7492,"I know.  It went out of style, didn't it?",xxx
7493,"It's okay.  It's a good thing.  You know, it's lovely here and the air is sweet.",xxx
7494,So you're not sorry you came?,xxx
7495,"No, not sorry, but I'm not going to stay.",xxx
7496,Why?,xxx
7497,"In the first place, your mother as much as told me to go.",xxx
7498,You saw that and then you've been kind of--,xxx
7499,What?,xxx
7500,"Well, kind of embarrassed ever since I got here.",xxx
7501,The trouble is I planned on sneaking up on you over a period of a week or so.  But they take it for granted that we're all set.,xxx
7502,"I knew they would, your mother, anyway.",xxx
7503,How did you know?,xxx
7504,"From her point of view, why else would I come?",xxx
7505,Well wouldn't you want to?,xxx
7506,I guess you know this is why I asked you to come.,xxx
7507,I guess this is why I came.,xxx
7508,"Ann, I love you.  I love you a great deal.  I love you.",xxx
7509,I have no imagination.  That's all I know to tell you.  I'm embarrassing you.,xxx
7510,I didn't want to tell it to you here.  I wanted someplace we'd never been; someplace where we'd be brand new to each other.,xxx
7511,"You think this is wrong, don't you; this yard, this chair?  I want you to be ready for me.  I don't want to win you away from anything.",xxx
7512,"Chris, I've been ready a long, long time.",xxx
7513,Then he's gone forever?  You're sure?,xxx
7514,I almost got married two years ago.,xxx
7515,Why didn't you?,xxx
7516,You started to write me.,xxx
7517,You felt something that far back?,xxx
7518,Every day since.,hap
7519,"Anne, why didn't you let me know?",xxx
7520,"I was waiting for you, Chris.  'Til then, you never wrote and when you did, what did you say?  You sure can be ambiguous, you know.",hap
7521,"Anne, give me a kiss.  Give me a -",xxx
7522,"I kissed you.  I kissed Annie.  How long, how long I've waited to kiss you.",xxx
7523,I'll never forgive you.  Why did you wait all these years?  All I've done is sit around and wonder if I was crazy for thinking of you.,hap
7524,"Anne, we're going to live now.  I'm going to make you so happy.",xxx
7525,Not like that you're not.,xxx
7526,I kissed you.,xxx
7527,"Like Larry's brother.  Do it like you, Chris.  What is it, Chris?",xxx
7528,Let's drive somewhere.  I want to be alone with you.,xxx
7529,"No, what is it, Chris?  Your mother?",xxx
7530,"No, no, nothing like that.",xxx
7531,"Then what's wrong.  Even in your letters, there was something ashamed.",xxx
7532,"Yes, I suppose there has been.  But it's going from me.",sad
7533,You've got to tell me.,xxx
7534,I don't know where to start.,sad
7535,It wouldn't work this way.,xxx
7536,"It's all mixed up with so many other things.  You remember overseas, I was in command of a company?",sad
7537,"Yeah, sure.",xxx
7538,Well I lost them.,sad
7539,How many?,sad
7540,Just about all.,sad
7541,"Oh, gees.",sad
7542,It takes a little time to toss that off because they weren't just men.,sad
7543,"For instance, one time it'd been raining several days.  And this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks; put them in my pocket.  That's only a little thing, but that's the kind of guys I had.",sad
7544,They didn't die.  They killed themselves for each other.  I mean that exactly.  A little more selfish and they'd have been here today.,xxx
7545,"And I got this idea watching them go down, everything was being destroyed, see?  But, to me, it seemed there was one new thing that was made,",sad
7546,a kind of responsibility.  Man for man.  You understand me?  And then I went home and it was incredible.,sad
7547,"There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident.  Then I went to work for dad and that whole rat race again.  I felt, what you said, ashamed somehow",sad
7548,because nobody was changed.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive;,sad
7549,"to open that bank book; to drive the new car; to see the new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take these things out of a war, but when you drive the new car, you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.",sad
7550,"You have to be a little better because of that.  Otherwise, we have is really loot and there's blood on it.  I don't want to take any of it.  I guess that included you.",sad
7551,And do you still feel that way?,xxx
7552,"I want you now, Annie.",xxx
7553,"Because you mustn't feel that way anymore, Chris.  Because you have a right to everything you have, everything, Chris; to me, too.",xxx
7554,"And your money, there's nothing wrong in your money.  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air.  You should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",xxx
7555,"Annie, Annie, I'm going to make you a fortune.",hap
7556,What'll I do with a fortune?,hap
7557,"What time is it?  They're supposed to run around midnight.  This is great, isn't it?  Look at this night we've got here; couldn't be better.",xxx
7558,"Actually, I wanted to go a little farther up the coast, get away from the lights and the people, but I was afraid we'd miss it.  How you doing?",exc
7559,Fine.,neu
7560,"Is that, is that - is that just foam?  I can't even tell.  Although, if you can't tell, it's probably isn't them.  It'll probably be unmistakable, don't you think?",exc
7561,"How you doing?  Oh, no, you know what I did?  I forgot to bring my flashlight.  How could I be so stupid?  I should have brought my flashlight.",exc
7562,What flashlight?,xxx
7563,"The flashlight; the silver one.  There's only one, isn't there?",xxx
7564,It's not yours.,ang
7565,Whose is it?,neu
7566,"It's ours.  It's mine, too.",ang
7567,"Well, sure.",fru
7568,You kept saying my flashlight as if it's somehow just yours.  How is that supposed to make me feel?,ang
7569,"No, of course, our flashlight; yours and mine.  Me flashlight es su flashlight, naturally.  How could we not think to bring it?  I hope the moon stays out.",xxx
7570,"I wonder, do they always run during a full moon? I can't remember if it was full last year.  Remember?",exc
7571,Yes.,ang
7572,"Are you cold?  Do you want my jacket?  We should have brought the blanket, our blanket.",neu
7573,"Oh, man.  This is great.  I didn't even think to bring a six pack.  Six pack would be just the ticket right about now.  I can't believe I forgot.  I'm like a kid.  It's amazing I got out of the house with my fly zipped.  Oh.",xxx
7574,I wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around.,xxx
7575,I'm cold.,xxx
7576,You want my jacket?,neu
7577,It's after eleven; let's go home.,ang
7578,Are you kidding?  We'd miss it.  We just got here.  What's the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home?,fru
7579,There is no point in coming down here.,ang
7580,Right.,neu
7581,That's my point.,fru
7582,"That's my point, too.",neu
7583,So let's go home.,ang
7584,"No, no, no.  That's not my point.  My point is is that there's no point in coming down here if we just leave.  Don't you want to see it?",fru
7585,Not particularly.,fru
7586,Why not?,xxx
7587,I just don't.  It's stupid.,ang
7588,"Honey, this is a natural phenomenon.  I mean, this only happens once a year.  It's a great opportunity.  Think about the people in Kansas.  They'd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this.  We're just forty minutes away.  It's too good to pass up.",exc
7589,"Pass up what?  These little fish swim onto the beach, flop around and then they swim away.  And then they die.",ang
7590,"Yeah, but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives.  I mean, all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you -- spawning or mating, something like that.",fru
7591,There's mystery here and magic.,exc
7592,What are you so excited about?,neu
7593,"Oh, it's a big night for these guys.  Uh, life's last orgy.",exc
7594,This isn't a moon landing we're talking about.  It's fish.  It's fish nobody even eats.,fru
7595,"Yeah, they do. Okay.  But it's fish who do something none of the other fish do; like the swallows are returning to Capistrano; or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs, like that.",exc
7596,There's mystery here and magic; a little bit of the unexplainable.  I don't see how you can not be interested.,exc
7597,I'm just not.,fru
7598,For real?,sur
7599,Yes.,ang
7600,"I don't get it.  First time we came here to see it, you said it was the best night of your life.  And last year, I remember distinctly you were so excited to get here, you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didn't even notice until we were in the car.",xxx
7601,"Last year, you will also remember, our shoes got wet.  I got sand in my panties.  We got into a big fight over nothing.  You got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions.",ang
7602,We weren't in a good spot.,xxx
7603,We didn't see them the first time either.,fru
7604,We just weren't in a good spot.  This is a much better spot.  I've got good instincts for these things.  Look there.  What's that?  Is that -,xxx
7605,"no, it's just seaweed, isn't it?  Oh, man, this is great.  I wouldn't miss this for anything.  I mean, think about this.  I know you're not interested, but just think about this for a minute.",exc
7606,Out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way.  They don't know why.  We don't know why.  It wasn't a decision.  They didn't take a vote.  No one sent them an invitation or a map;,exc
7607,"just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one, they turned and formed a line as long as the California coast and started swimming.",exc
7608,They're swimming right now as if that's the only thing that matters.  It's single mindedness with no mind.  Urgency that's pure urge.,exc
7609,"They don't know what drives them.  They don't give it a name or ask a question.  They just turn, as one, and start the swim that brings them here; to this place, where we stand, for a massive celebration of sex and death.  Oh, man, I'm giving myself goose bumps.  All my hairs are popping up.",exc
7610,That's the wind.,fru
7611,Well so what did you think?,exc
7612,About what?,fru
7613,"Look at this, goose bumps.",neu
7614,Well so what'd you think?,neu
7615,About what?,xxx
7616,What I said.,neu
7617,It's ridiculous.,xxx
7618,Certainly is not.  It's slightly exaggerated scientific fact.,fru
7619,It's PR.  Somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach.,xxx
7620,I'm not the only one.  Look at these people.,xxx
7621,Sure.  They're all told the same story.  It's what keeps us coming back for more; keeps us excited; keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we could just find the right spot; get in on the action.,xxx
7622,Are we talking about the same thing?,xxx
7623,"Well, I'm sorry, but it's still just fish to me.",xxx
7624,"Carla, can I ask you something?  Don't take this the wrong way, but are you having your period?",fru
7625,"Goddamn it, Augie, don't ask me that.  I hate it when you ask me that.  You always ask me that.  It's insulting.",ang
7626,Well what's bugging you?,ang
7627,We just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like.,ang
7628,"There's nothing to it.  We come down here.  The grunions arrive.  They do their little fish business.  We go ooh, ah, look at the fish.  They go home.  We go home.",ang
7629,"For heaven's sake, we are not going to see the grunions.",xxx
7630,Why not?,xxx
7631,"We never do, do we?  Have we ever?",ang
7632,We've missed them twice.,xxx
7633,That's not ever.,xxx
7634,Twice is every time we've tried.  That's ever.,fru
7635,We'll see them this year.,fru
7636,"No, we won't.  It's pointless.  It's like waiting up to see Santa Claus.  I feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up.  And the fish won't show up.",xxx
7637,I thought you wanted to see them.,xxx
7638,You don't have any idea what I'm saying.,fru
7639,"No, of course, not.",fru
7640,"I did want to see it.  I always do.  I keep thinking this time will be the time, but it never is.",ang
7641,It's just fish; nothing to get traumatized over.,fru
7642,"For heaven's sake, this is not about fish.",xxx
7643,"I've been trying to work this backwards, but I can't seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse.",fru
7644,"You were fine during the phone call from Marge.  Dinner was okay.  Doing the dishes was no problem.  Let's see, I took a shower.  Uh, you watched the news.  You said the grunions are running tonight.  I said great, let's go.  I feel lucky tonight.",fru
7645,"Uh,okay.  So I'm putting on my jacket; putting out the animals;",fru
7646,Do you remember the first time we came to see it?,xxx
7647,"uh, taking the car out of the gara- out of the garage.",fru
7648,Uh.,fru
7649,"It was about four years ago, right after we got married.  We thought I was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses.  You asked me to dance.  So we took off our shoes and you popped the cork.",sad
7650,"And while we were dancing, you said the softest, most intimate things to me, right into my ear so that I could feel them as much as hear them.  And I remember thinking this is it.  At last, at last I'm as happy as I'm supposed to be.",xxx
7651,"Wait a minute, I've got it.",neu
7652,Dancing barefoot in the sand; drinking champagne from the bottle.,sad
7653,"It was in the car, right?  Driving past the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker?  You said let's get some champagne and I said times a wasting or something like that.  Right?  That's it, right?  You want this to be like the other time.  That's it.  Of course.",neu
7654,I'd rather not remember some things.  I'd rather not hope for some things.,sad
7655,Sure.  Okay.  Alright.  I've got it.  Listen do you want to dance?,xxx
7656,No.,sad
7657,You want to get some champagne?,xxx
7658,No.,sad
7659,"What, you want me to breathe in your ear?",fru
7660,No.,fru
7661,You want to get married again?,fru
7662,No.,fru

7665,A vacation?,fru
7666,No.,ang

7668,I want something to turn out the way it's supposed to.,ang
7669,"Well welcome to the human race.  You think this is what I had in mind?  You think that when I proposed, I had this great fantasy going that four years down the line, we'd come to the beach and yell at each other over fish?  No.",ang
7670,"No, I'm just like you.  I thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and wind in our hair and sand in our toes and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves.",xxx
7671,"And we'll have three fat rosy kids and ha, ha, ha, baby, the joke's on us, 'cause you know what you get, Carla?  You know what you get?  This.",ang
7672,This what?  What is this?  This isn't even anything.,ang
7673,"Yes, it is.",fru
7674,"Oh, right, sure.  This is standing on the beach.   This is waiting.  This is fighting.",ang
7675,Right.,fru
7676,But this isn't anything like I thought anything would be like.,ang
7677,"No, I know, me neither.",ang

7679,I'm doing the best I can.,fru
7680,"I know you are, Augie.  Really, I do.  I know you meant for this to be special and nice and it's the full moon and the sand and everything.  But I just couldn't help thinking about being somewhere else.",fru
7681,"Maybe if you were with somebody else, too, huh?",xxx
7682,I didn't say that.,sad
7683,"No, I know.  But still.  I know I don't make you happy.",sad
7684,"For heaven's sake, whatever I'm doing, I'd rather be doing it with you.",xxx
7685,Yeah?,sur
7686,Well don't be ridiculous.  Don't you know that?  You're the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else; somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didn't take everything so hard.,xxx
7687,"Actually, now that you mention it, no.  I don't.",hap
7688,"Okay, fine.  So we're in the wrong spot, but we're with the right person.",hap
7689,"I don't know.  It seemed like a good spot to me.  I mean, look at the view you've got of the moon from here.",hap

8256,"Well, you know, sometimes that's--really, I mean what else could we do?",neu

8263,"No, but I mean like why can't- why can't you find it?  Where did it go?  Who lost it?",ang
8264,"Well, if I knew that, then I'd know where it was, wouldn't I?",xxx
8265,"Well, I just-I paid so much money for this ticket.  I feel like you guys should be able to get-to offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher.",ang
8266,"Well, we're talking about one bag.  You personally made it here, didn't you?",neu
8267,"Yeah, meaning I didn't die in a fiery plane crash.  How convenient, but um- I paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline, and I would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place.",ang
8268,That's what the cost of the ticket was for.,fru
8269,"Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-",fru
8270,"Right, but part of the agreement is that I'm paying so that I can take myself and my belongings with me.",ang
8271,"Right. Yes, ma'am.",fru
8272,And that you're going to transport them safely from one place to another.,ang
8273,"Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.",fru
8274,"That's all you can offer me? I mean, my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar.",ang
8275,"Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?",neu
8276,No.,xxx
8277,"Well, my hands are really tied then.",neu
8278,Why do I need flight insurance?  Why don't you guys just guarantee that you're going to get the stuff that I leave with to my destination?,fru
8279,"Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--",neu
8280,"Right, but if I'm riding a bus, I don't need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack I take on is going to get to my destination with me.",fru
8281,"Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?",neu
8282,Because they made me check it.  It's too heavy.,fru
8283,"Uh, so it was really heavy.",neu
8284,"So I would have carried it on, but they made me check it and then they lost it.",xxx
8285,"Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.",fru
8286,There's nothing else you can do?,fru
8287,"I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.",neu
8288,I don't believe that for a second.,ang
8289,Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.,neu
8290,"Obviously, I'm doing everything that I can here.",fru
8291,"No, I don't think you are. I mean If you were doing everything you could, you'd either give me more money or you'd figure out where my bag is.",xxx
8292,"Well, I have no way to give you more money.  I'm giving you as much money as I can, and figuring- as far as figuring out where you bag is-",neu
8293,What do you mean as you can?  Who makes up these rules?,ang
8294,makes up?,neu
8295,You're an autono- autonomous human being.  You could- You could go into the com-,ang
8296,"The airline makes these rules, mom ma'am.",neu
8297,You could go into the computer and- you know- print-,xxx
8298,I've gone into the computer.  I told you exactly what I can see in the computer that your luggage did arrive here.,xxx
8299,"So I'm just supposed to oh, well, oops, my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher?",fru
8300,"Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.",fru
8301,And you have no guarantee.,fru
8302,"I have no guarantee, absolutely not.",fru
8303,This is ridiculous.,fru
8304,How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?,fru
8305,"Uh- Because you guys lost it, so it should be your responsibility to find it, too.",fru
8306,"Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?",fru
8307,"Oh, come on.  Would you cut it out?  This is ridiculous.",fru
8308,"Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous",fru
8309,"No, I don't think I am.  I like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me, and I brought it you know from Africa.  It's not like I can just go back and get it whenever I want.",ang
8310,Right.,neu
8311,It's not like I can go to Kmart and buy another.,ang
8312,"I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.",fru
8313,"And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.",neu

8498,"Right, right, and since--yeah, since it was just a computer glitch, then that's that should be cleared up as well.  So I'm going to go ahead and try and put that into the computer.  And if for some reason you notice on your statement in a few days that you've been charged and an overdue fee, then you should just call back and we'll have that.",neu

8526,What was he doing out here at four in the morning?,xxx
8527,I don't know.  but When it cracked he ran back into the house and start to cry in the kitchen.,sad
8528,Did you talk to him?,sad
8529,No.  I figured it was best to leave him alone.,sad
8530,He cried hard.,sad
8531,I could hear him right through the floor of my room.,sad
8532,He is thinking about him again.,sad
8533,"It's getting just like after Larry died, he's having dreams, he's walking around at night.",sad
8534,"I guess, he is.",sad
8535,What's the meaning of that?,sad
8536,I don't know the meaning of it.  But I know one thing mom did.  We made a terrible mistake with dad.,sad
8537,What?,xxx
8538,Being dishonest with him.  It's the kind of thing that pays off and now it's paying off.,sad
8539,"What do you mean, dishonest?",xxx
8540,"You know that Larry's not coming back, and I know it.  So why do we go on letting him think that we believe with him?",sad
8541,"What are you going to do, argue with him?",xxx
8542,"No um, I don't want to argue with him, but it's time we realized that nobody else believes that Larry is alive.",fru
8543,"Why shouldn't he dream about him, walk around during the night, looking for him um.  Do we contradict him?  Do we say outright that we don't have any hope anymore, that we haven't had any for years now?",fru
8544,You can't just say that to him.,xxx
8545,We have to say it to him!,fru
8546,"How are you going to prove it, I mean, there's no body and there's no grave.  So what are you going to do? Do you have proof?",xxx
8547,"For God's sake, mom, three years.  Nobody comes back after three years!  It's insane!",ang
8548,"To you it is, and to me, but not to your father.  Now look, you can talk yourself  blue in the face, but there's no body, and there's no grave, so where are you?",fru
8549,"Sit down, mom.  I want to talk to you.",fru
8550,"The trouble with the god damned newspapers, I mean every week, they do a story about some boy's been gone longer than Larry and he comes back, so the next one is gonna--",xxx
8551,"All right, All right mom.  Listen!",fru
8552,"You know why I asked Annie here, don't you?",sad
8553,why?,xxx
8554,You know.,fru
8555,Well I got an idea.  But what's the story?,neu
8556,I'm going to ask her to marry me.,neu
8557,"Well that's nobody's business but yours, Chris.",xxx
8558,You know that's not just my business.,fru
8559,"What- What am - what are you going to do, I mean you're old enough to make up your own mind?",xxx
8560,So it's all right.  I can go ahead with it then?,fru
8561,Well you're want to make sure your father isn't you know going to--lose them,xxx
8562,Then it's not only my business.  Sometimes you infuriate me.  You know that?,xxx
8563,"You know that?  Isn't it your business too, if I tell dad, and he gets, throws a fit about it?   you have such a talent for ignoring things!",xxx
8564,I ignore what I got to ignore.  The girl is Larry's girl.,fru
8565,She's not Larry's girl!,xxx
8566,"As far as your father is concerned, he's not dead and you've no right to take his girl.",xxx
8567,"Now Chris you can go on from there, but I don't know what to do.  I mean do you know what to do, because I don't.",fru
8568,"I don't know why it is.  But every time I reach out for something I want, I have to pull back because other people will suffer.  My whole bloody life, time after time, after time.",fru
8569,"Well you're a considerate fellow, there's nothing wrong with that.",neu
8570,To hell with that!,ang
8571,Have you asked Annie yet to marry you?,neu
8572,I want to get this settled first.,xxx
8573,"Well how did you know that she will go along with it, I mean maybe she feels the same way as your father?",neu
8574,"Well, if she does, then that's the end of it, but from her letters it sounds like she's forgotten about it.  I'll find out and then we'll thrash it out with Dad, all right?  Mom, don't avoid me.",xxx
8575,"The trouble is you don't see enough women, you never have",neu
8576,"So what, I'm not fast with women.",fru
8577,Well I just don't see why it has to be Annie.,neu
8578,Because it is.,fru
8579,"well, that's a good reason, but it doesn't answer a thing.",xxx
8580,"I can't help it.  I know her best.  I was brought up next door to here, the easiest, when I think of somebody for my wife, I think of Annie.  Do you want a diagram?",fru
8581,"No, I don't want a diagram, but, Chris, your father thinks Larry's coming back.",fru
8582,"You marry his girl, and you're pronouncing him dead.  Now what's going to happen to your father, do you know?  I don't.",sad
8583,"All right, then, Mom.",fru
8584,Give it some more thought.,xxx
8585,"I've given it three years of thought.  And hope by now that he wouldn't.  Can you forget about Larry an-- and we can have a regular wedding and have everybody be happy.  But that can't happen here, I'm set to get out.",fru
8586,What the hell is this?,ang
8587,"I'll get out. I'll get married and live some place else.  Maybe, maybe New York?",fru
8588,Are you crazy?,ang
8589,"I've been a good son for too long, a big sucker.  I'm through with it.",xxx
8590,Wait a minute.  Tell me this.  Do you mean to say that you would leave the business?,fru
8591,The business?  The business?  It doesn't inspire me?,ang
8592,Must you be inspired?,xxx
8593,"Yes!  I like it an hour a day.  If I had to grub for money all day long, I like to come home to something beautiful.  I want a family.  I want- I want kids.  I want to build something I can give myself to. and Annie is in the center of that, and now where do I find it?",xxx
8594,"Don't- you, you can't think like that!  Don't think like that!",fru
8595,Then help me stay here.,xxx
8596,"All right!  But don't think like that, because I mean, what the hell did we do all this for, Chris?  The whole business it's all for you!  The whole shooting match is for you!",ang
8597,I know that Mom. I know.  Just you help me stay here.,xxx
8598,"All right, but don't think like that.",xxx
8599,I am thinking like that.,xxx
8600,"I don't understand you, do I?",fru
8601,No.  You don't.  I'm a pretty tough guy.,xxx
8602,"Yeah, I can see that.",xxx
8603,Why did you invite her here?,xxx
8604,Why does that bother you?,neu
8605,She's been in New York three and a half years.  Why all of the sudden?,neu
8606,Well maybe.  Maybe she just wanted to see her again.,neu
8607,Nobody comes seven hundred miles just to see.,xxx
8608,"What did you mean? He lived next door to the girl all of his life, why wouldn't he want to see her again? Don't look at me like that, he didn't tell me any more than he told you.",neu
8609,He's not going to marry her.,xxx
8610,How do you know he is even thinking about it?,fru
8611,It's got that about it.,xxx
8612,"Well, so what.",fru
8613,"What's going on here, Joe?",fru
8614,"Now, listen, Kate, just-",fru
8615,She's not his girl.  She knows she's not.,ang
8616,You can't read her mind.,xxx
8617,"She's . . . Then why is she still single.  New York is full of men, why isn't she married?  Probably a hundred people told her she's foolish, but she's waited.",fru
8618,How do you know why she's waited?,fru
8619,Because she knows what I know - she's faithful as a rock and my worst moments I think of her waiting and I know again that I'm right.,fru
8620,Look.  It's a nice day.  Why are we arguing?,fru
8621,"Nobody in her- this house dares shake her faith.  Strangers might, but not his father, and not his brother.",fru
8622,What do you want me to do? What do you want--,fru
8623,I want you to pretend like he's coming back!,ang
8624,"But, Kate...",fru

8681,I don't know how to start.,xxx
8682,It wouldn't work like this.,sad

8686,Yeah.  I lost them.,sad
8687,how many?,sad
8688,just about all.,sad
8689,Oh gee.,sad
8690,Takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they weren't just men-,sad
8691,"for instance, there's this one time.  It had been raining for several days.  And this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks. you know, He just put them in my pocket.",sad
8692,"I know that- that's not a big thing, but it's just the kind of guys I had. They didn't die. They- They killed themselves for each other.",sad
8693,I mean that exactly that-a little more selfish and they would have still been here today.,sad
8694,"And I got an ideal, watching them all go down.  Everything was being destroyed see and-",sad
8695,"but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time, a kind of responsibility, man for man.  Do you understand me?",sad
8696,And to show that-to-to bring that back onto the earth again like a- like a monument.  And everyone would have it standing behind them and- and it would make a difference for them.,sad
8697,And then I went home and it was incredible.  It had no meaning here.,sad
8698,"It was all like some kind of bus accident to them.  I went back to work with my dad, in that whole rat race again.",sad
8699,And I felt what you said- ashamed somehow-because nobody had changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys. and,sad
8700,"It felt wrong to be alive-to open that bank-book; to buy that new car; to look at that new refrigerator.  I mean, you can take those things out of the war, but if you drive that car, you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man.  And you've got to be a little bit better than that!",sad
8701,"And if you're not, then it's all just loot and it's got blood on it, and I don't want any of it!  And, I guess that included you.",xxx
8702,Do you still feel like that?,neu
8703,"I I want you now, Annie.",exc
8704,"Because you can't feel like that anymore Chris, you hear me?  I mean everything that you have, you deserve.  And that includes me.  And your father?  Your father put hundreds of planes in the air, you should be proud.  A man should be paid for that.",sad
8705,"Oh Annie.  Annie, I am going to make you a fortune!",hap
8706,What would I do with a fortune?,hap

I've been transferred to, like, eight different departments and I've told my problem to every single department, and then they just send me to another one and say they are going to send all my information so I won't have to repeat it, and then that person doesn't know what's going on.  And I've restated my story about eight different times and I just want somebody to help me get my connection back, because this happens every two weeks.  And I want to know what to do to stop it from happening again.",fru
9423,This happens every two weeks?,neu
9424,Yeah.  That my service just goes out.,fru
9425,You've lost your connection.,neu
9426,yeah.,fru

9435,"Well, you know what, does your D.S.L. cable -- you have D.S.L., right?",neu
9436,Hmm. Mmm.,neu
9437,"Okay.  Does your D.S.L. cable, you know, travel a long distance by any chance? - Does it go through any windows?  I mean, is it --",neu
9438,yeah.,neu
9439,"It goes- It goes, like, through doorways.  But it goes a long distance.",neu
9440,"Okay.  Is it being- Is it being compressed between anything by any chance?  Because sometimes your connection can be you know, disrupted by, you know, the cable being squished.",neu
9441,Oh really?,xxx
9442,"Yeah. That can be- That can create a bad connection.  And it won't always be a bad connection, but it will be bad off and on.",neu
9443,"Well, I- I can check that.  Is there anything else we can do, too?  Like, I'll go through and check the line throughout the house, but --",neu

9459,"Uh, yeah looks -- no, no.  It's set to zeros.",neu
9460,"It's set to zeros.  Okay, maybe that's our problem.  That could very well be our problem there.  Somehow you've lost your IP address.  I'm not sure why that would happen every week.  It could be a cycling issue, something like that.  But let's go ahead and type your IP address in again.",neu
9461,"what happening - So if we reset this, how will I know it's not going to happen again every other week?",xxx

9499,"What do you want to do, argue with him?",fru
9500,I don't want to argue with him.  But it's time he knows that nobody else thinks that Larry's alive anymore.,fru

9533,"Well, the trouble is you never saw enough women.",neu
9534,So what?  I'm not fast with women.,ang
9535,"Well, I just don't see why it has to be Annie.",fru
9536,Because it is.,fru

9796,somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction.  They don't know why they're doing it.  We don't know why they're doing it.  They didn't- It wasn't a decision.  No one took a vote.  Nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that.  It was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off. And all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the California coastline and they just started swimming.  They are swimming right now at this very moment.   And And-,exc

9813,What's bugging you then?,fru
9814,I just - We just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like.,fru

So, I'm taking a shower, you're watching TV, the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and I say, Great, let's go.  I'm feeling lucky.

No.  No, I'm just like you. I thought it would all be like peaches and roses, and sand in our toes, and wind in our hair, and the fish would always come.
